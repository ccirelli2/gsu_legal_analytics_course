BORDER WALL
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I be-
lieve the President’s decision to tempo-
rarily resolve the shutdown was the
correct one. The Democrats’ refusal
even to discuss a path forward had cre-
ated a crisis of governance, in addition
to our ongoing crisis on the southern
border.
The President had offered many com-
promises to the Democrats. He reduced
his funding request, altered the design,
and added nearly $1 billion of humani-
tarian aid. Yet, the Democrats spurned
all of these good faith overtures.
When the President invited congres-
sional Democrats to the Oval Office to
hear their views, they refused to go.
They had plenty of time to vacation in
Puerto Rico with 100 lobbyists during
the shutdown, but they couldn’t seem
to fit a simple meeting with the Presi-
dent into their busy schedules in order
to resolve it.
Based on their past behavior, I am
skeptical their position will change
over the next 3 weeks.
They tell us there is no crisis. Well,
the facts speak for themselves. Be-
tween 16 million and 29 million people
now are living illegally in the United
States, costing American taxpayers
well over $100 billion a year to support.
Sixty thousand more are illegally
crossing our border every month. In
2017, illegal aliens murdered 1,800
Americans and violently assaulted
48,000 more.
The congressional Democrats who op-
pose the President’s wall insist that
they support border security, but they
say a wall is a costly and ineffective
way to stop illegal immigration. Well,
it is hard to take either of their claims
seriously.
These same politicians have long ad-
vocated for providing a wide range of
services for illegal immigrants, rang-
ing from healthcare and legal counsel
to education and housing, all at tax-
payer expense. It is hard to believe
they want to discourage illegal immi-
gration while they reward those who il-
legally immigrate.
The Democrats long ago ceased to
call illegal immigration what it is: ille-
gal. Many have gone so far as to advo-
cate abolishing the agencies that de-
fend our borders and enforce our immi-
gration laws. They have enacted sanc-
tuary laws that protect dangerous
criminals from deportation. They have
opposed mandatory employment verifi-
cation to hold employers accountable
for hiring illegals. And they have op-
posed visa tracking of foreign nationals
entering our country.
They tell us that walls are medieval
and what we really need are sophisti-
cated cameras. Well, we don’t want to
watch them crossing our border; we
want to stop them.
Walls have been used for thousands of
years to impede unauthorized entry for
one reason: They work, and they still
work. When Israel built a 143-mile wall
to protect its southern border, illegal
immigration fell 99 percent. The cost of
building a wall is a fraction of the cost
incurred by American citizens every
year to support the illegal population
already in our country.
It doesn’t address the whole problem,
but a wall would be a tremendous force
multiplier for border enforcement
agencies. It would protect them from
the violent attacks to which they are
constantly subjected and allow them to
apply their slender resources more effi-
ciently and effectively.
If the Democrats continue to oppose
serious measures to defend our borders
and enforce our laws, I urge the Presi-
dent to use the authority Congress
granted in 1976 to reprogram already
appropriated but unobligated military
construction funds for the defense of
our Nation. What is more fundamental
to national defense than the security
and integrity of our own borders?
Some argue that this would divert
money from other Defense Department
projects. Well, it is an odd logic that
argues that defending the Iraqi border
is more important than defending our
own.
Others have worried that a Presi-
dential order would provoke a pro-
tracted legal challenge. Isn’t that true
of any course the President could take?
Others worry that leftist activists
would misuse this precedent. Well, let
me ask you: When have such activists

ever relied on precedent to expand
their power?
Using this authority would not only
build the wall, it would avoid the need
to meet any demands to further dimin-
ish or dilute our current immigration
laws.
If the next 3 weeks produce the un-
reasonable demands and intransigence
that we have come to expect from the
Democratic leadership, I strongly urge
the President to use his existing au-
thority. Countries that either cannot
or will not enforce their borders simply
aren’t around very long. Let that not
be America’s epitaph.
f
UPCOMING HUNGER CRISIS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN) for 5
minutes.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, last
Friday, the President, finally, ended
the longest government shutdown in
our Nation’s history.
For 35 days, activity at several gov-
ernment agencies halted. The wages of
hardworking public servants were
being used as bargaining chips to push
a medieval solution to what should
have been a modern discussion on how
to protect our borders.
The President seemed tone deaf to all
the devastation that came with the
government shutdown. At one point, he
said that he would keep our govern-
ment shut down for ‘‘months or even
years.’’ In a speech on Friday, he stun-
ningly said that Federal workers were
encouraging him to continue the shut-
down.
I would love to know who he was
talking to, because that is the opposite
of what I was hearing from my con-
stituents and Federal workers all
across this country. There aren’t many
people out there who can afford to
work for free, much less people who are
willing to forego their paychecks for a
stupid, ridiculous campaign promise.
No one should be expected to work for
weeks without pay. What the President
did, by shutting down our government,
was disrespectful to our Federal work-
ers.
If the government shutdown contin-
ued for a few more weeks, programs
like SNAP and WIC, and child nutri-
tion programs, would have run out of
money, putting millions of families at
risk of food insecurity.
Last week, I heard from one of my
constituents in Ware, Massachusetts.
She is a single mom who is disabled,
and she depends on programs like So-
cial Security and SNAP every day to
help put food on the table for her two
children. She was worried about a lapse
in SNAP funding because, for a while
now, she has been going without meals
so that her kids can eat. She is barely
able to provide for herself, but she is
making sacrifices that any parent
would make to provide for her children.
If the President decides to shut down
the government again in a few weeks,
he could provoke a full-blown hunger
crisis in this country.
Low-income families should not have
to worry about where their next meal
is coming from just because the Presi-
dent wants taxpayers to pay for his
wall. In fact, government employees
might need SNAP benefits themselves,
if their pay is cut off again.
In the past 4 weeks, I only can say
how grateful I have been to the Amer-
ican people who have demonstrated in-
credible compassion to those impacted
by the shutdown. Countless businesses
provided free meals and resources to
help families through rough times.
Yesterday, I was at Jose Andres’
World Central Kitchen’s Chefs for Feds
initiative, where he is feeding Federal
workers who have not been paid. As of
yesterday, they still have not been
paid.
While many families have accepted
help, they still took on expenses that
couldn’t be recovered. Many families
went into debt, just to keep a roof over
their heads and food on the table. Oth-
ers took on interest, late fees, pen-
alties, and payment deferrals, not be-
cause they did anything wrong, but be-
cause their President thought he could
strong-arm Congress.
These are people who have jobs, show
up, and work every day for their coun-
try. The least we can do is pay them
and keep their government running.
This administration might not un-
derstand why families need resources
like food banks, but I think the rest of
us do. Unlike the President, we don’t
all have a rich family who can loan us
money. Unlike the Secretary of Com-
merce, Wilbur Ross, not all of us have
investment fortunes to fall back on.
While living paycheck to paycheck
might not be a reality they under-
stand, it is a reality for millions of
families who depend not only on their
jobs, but also on programs like SNAP
and WIC to survive.
Government shutdowns and spending
gaps have real consequences for real
American families. They cause confu-
sion, backlogs, delays, and discord. It
could take months and years for us to
fully recover from the past 35 days.
What is particularly ironic about the
shutdown, Mr. Speaker, is that all of
this could have been avoided if the
President signed the bipartisan bills we
sent him back in December.
The President should never again
hold the American people hostage to
get his way. I will do all I can to fight
against using public servants as bar-
gaining chips. I will do all I can to help
protect programs like SNAP and WIC,
and child nutrition programs. They
need to keep running.
Three weeks of funding is just a
patch on the hunger crisis that this
country will soon face if we don’t pass
another comprehensive spending bill.
SNAP, WIC, and child nutrition pro-
grams matter to people’s lives.
Families, children, farmers, and food
businesses don’t deserve this, and there
is no time to waste. There is no time
like the present. Let’s end hunger now.
RECOGNIZING GOVERNOR BRIAN
KEMP
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Georgia (Mr. LOUDERMILK) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, on
January 14, 2019, at a joint session of
the Georgia General Assembly that was
held on the campus of Georgia Insti-
tute of Technology in Atlanta, Geor-
gia, the Honorable Brian Kemp was in-
augurated as the 83rd Governor of the
State of Georgia. Upon taking the oath
of office, Brian Kemp became the third
Republican to occupy the Governor’s
mansion since reconstruction.
Even before taking the oath of office,
Brian was already making history, re-
ceiving more votes than any guber-
natorial candidate in State history.
As with many of Georgia’s Gov-
ernors, Governor Kemp comes from a
humble background. He was a small
business owner, building his first con-
struction business with a pickup and a
shovel. With hard work and personal
sacrifice, he grew that business and
eventually became one of Georgia’s
successful entrepreneurs, responsible
for several successful businesses.
When Brian became frustrated with
the mismanagement of State govern-
ment, he determined that, instead of
just complaining, he would do some-
thing about it. He ran for a seat in the
State senate, and in 2003, this young
businessman from Athens was sworn in
as a freshman senator from the 46th
District.
Two years after Brian took office, I
was elected to the State house of rep-
resentatives and had the honor to work
with him on several key legislative ini-
tiatives. I could always count on Brian,
not only to be an ally, but to help per-
fect legislation as it moved through
the State senate.
Brian was, and still is, a strong con-
servative with the ability to reach
across the aisle to get things done for
Georgians. During his time in the sen-
ate, Brian was instrumental in fighting
to cut taxes, fees, and mandates on job
creators and Georgia families.
In 2008, Brian left the State senate
and returned to the private sector, but
his heart never left serving his State
and his community. In 2010, Governor
Sonny Perdue called on Brian to return
to public service, appointing him to
serve as Georgia’s secretary of state.
Brian easily won reelection as sec-
retary of state that same year and re-
mained in that post until he resigned
in November 2018.
As secretary of state, Brian wanted
to ensure that Georgia elections were
secure, accessible, and fair. In 2016,
being a member of this body’s Com-
mittee on Homeland Security, Brian
asked me to work with him to ensure
that Georgia’s election data was secure
from cyber threats.
During his tenure as secretary of
state, Brian utilized technology and in-
novation to cut bureaucratic red tape,
reduce spending, and streamline Geor-
gia’s government.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1249
January 29, 2019
Brian is known around the State as a
great businessman, a public servant,
and a statesman. However, Brian will
tell you, his most important job in life
is being a husband and a father. Brian
and his wife, Marty, have three daugh-
ters: Jarrett, Lucy, and Amy Porter.
The Kemps are a family tightly bound
by their strong faith, their commit-
ment to public service, and a love for
their community, their State, and
their country.
From the backhoe to the boardroom,
Brian Kemp understands how to suc-
cessfully create jobs, recruit startups,
grow companies, and make deals to
provide opportunities for hardworking
Georgians.
To communicate his commitment to
further growing Georgia’s thriving
economy, and to ensure all Georgians
have the opportunity to live, learn, and
prosper, Governor Kemp has made the
theme of his governorship ‘‘Putting
Georgians First.’’ I believe Governor
Brian Kemp will work for all Geor-
gians, and I look forward to working
with him as he leads Georgia forward.
Congratulations, Governor Kemp.

HONORING MAYOR GREG PETTIS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. RUIZ) for 5 minutes.
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to recognize and honor Mayor Greg
Pettis, a leader and devoted advocate
for our desert communities in Califor-
nia’s 36th Congressional District, who
unexpectedly passed away recently on
January 15.
I had the privilege of working with
Mayor Pettis to fight for equality and
social justice for the people of the
Coachella Valley.
Mayor Pettis set an example as a
public servant committed to protecting
the rights of all his constituents.
During his decades of service to our
communities, Mayor Pettis never
wavered in his advocacy for civil
rights, improved transportation, and
access to healthcare.
b 1015
As Cathedral City’s first openly gay
public servant and longest serving
council member, Mayor Pettis was a
trailblazer and a role model.
Every day, Mayor Pettis brought his
passion for helping others to the call to
public service. He helped our valley
build a public library, combat drug ad-
diction, and expand affordable housing.
Through his leadership and kindness,
Mayor Pettis will live on in the mem-
ory of his brothers, Stephen and David
Pettis, and the friends, neighbors, and
families whose lives he touched.
RECOGNIZING SUPERVISOR MARION ASHLEY
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Supervisor Marion Ashley
on his retirement after more than 35
years of public service.
Supervisor Ashley has served the
people in Riverside County since 2002
with leadership, integrity, respect, and
enthusiasm. He grew up in Riverside
County, California, and like me, has
had the privilege of returning home to
serve.
To see his positive impact on the cit-
ies of Banning, Beaumont, Calimesa,
and others, you only need to look
around. You will see medical centers,
public parks, wildlife conservation
areas, and fire stations that exist
thanks to his advocacy.
In retirement, I hope Supervisor Ash-
ley will enjoy spending more time with
Mary, his wife of more than 60 years,
and their 6 children, 19 grandchildren,
and 9 great-grandchildren.
On behalf of communities across Riv-
erside County, it is my honor to con-
gratulate Supervisor Ashley on a well-
earned retirement.

RECOGNITION OF BERGAD SPE-
CIALTY FOAMS & COMPOSITES
ON EXPANSION
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a
tremendous business in Armstrong
County, Bergad Specialty Foams.
Bergad Specialty Foams is a leading
producer of polyurethane foams. It re-
cently celebrated the completion of a
50,000-square-foot building expansion.
This is phase 1 of a long-range facil-
ity expansion, which will increase pro-
duction capacity to meet customer de-
mand for its growing line of specialty
foams. It will also allow the company
to accommodate the production of sev-
eral new product lines.
The expansion includes state-of-the-
art CNC cutting equipment and
streamlined fulfillment and shipping
areas, in addition to a secure manufac-
turing area to accommodate the re-
quirements of the consumer technology
industry.
Mr. Speaker, Bergad Foams makes
specialty cushioning materials that
span several markets, including med-
ical, cosmetic, oil and gas production,
high-end consumer electronics, and
transportation and aircraft.
I congratulate Paul Bergad, president
of Bergad Incorporated, on the out-
standing business he has built in Arm-
strong County, Pennsylvania.
When they broke ground on this
project, he refused the ceremonial
golden shovel and, instead, fired up his
excavator to take out the first bucket
of dirt. Clearly, Mr. Bergad is a man
who isn’t afraid to roll up his sleeves
and get to work.
With this new addition, the manufac-
turing area totals more than three
acres under one roof, making it one of
the largest manufacturing facilities in
the county.
Phase 2 of the expansion is expected
to begin in about 18 months and will
add an additional 35,000 square feet to
the facility. With these expansions,
Bergad Incorporated said they expect
to hire an additional 30 employees.
Mr. Speaker, this is very welcome
news in Armstrong County, where
Bergad Specialty Foams has its labora-
tory, manufacturing, fabrication, tool-
ing, warehousing, and sales division,
all located at its Kittanning facility.
Since Bergad Specialty Foams
opened operations there in 1999, the
mission has been to ‘‘exceed, not meet’’
the standards of the industry and the
expectations of its clients. Mr. Speak-
er, the ever-expanding product lines
and expansion surely note that Bergad
Specialty Foams is not only living up
to its lofty goals, but surpassing them.
I wholeheartedly congratulate Mr.
Bergad on this outstanding achieve-
ment, and I wish him the best as his
company continues to flourish in Arm-
strong County.

NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS OF
THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
New York (Mr. DELGADO) for 5 minutes.
Mr. DELGADO. Mr. Speaker, today I
rise, pleased that the government is re-
opened and determined to not repeat
ourselves in 3 weeks.
A poll taken last weekend found that
6 in 10 Americans believe the country
is headed in the wrong direction, and
nearly 70 percent have negative opin-
ions on the state of the Nation. These
findings are grim, but can anyone in
this Chamber blame our fellow citizens
for their skepticism?
The longest shutdown in American
history brought fear, confusion, and fi-
nancial harm on upstate New York and
our entire country—$11 billion worth of
economic loss, according to the CBO.
And here is what that looked like back
home in upstate New York:
The Small Business Administration
stopped processing new loans to poten-
tial small business owners, slowing the
engine of American enterprise;
The FDA stopped routine food safety
inspections, putting Americans at risk
at their own dinner tables;
The Department of Agriculture
stopped administering farm support
programs, which include subsidized
home loans and tariff relief payments,
putting additional financial stress on
farmers in upstate New York already
suffering from our Nation’s ill-con-
ceived trade wars;
The Department of Housing and
Urban Development stopped processing
mortgage extensions or housing loans,
leaving 100,000 rural homeowners at
risk of eviction;
The EPA suspended the cleanup ef-
forts at Superfund pollution sites, in-
cluding in places like Hoosick Falls,
with poisoned groundwater.
When the shutdown began, the EPA
stopped returning calls from the New
York Department of Environmental
Conservation. I held two townhalls dur-
ing the shutdown and opened up our
phone lines on weekends in order to re-
main accessible to those in my district
who need an advocate in Washington.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1250 January 29, 2019
I heard from constituent after con-
stituent about the negative repercus-
sions of the shutdown.
I heard from store owners who
couldn’t accept EBT cards because
their SNAP vendor license expired with
no possibility of renewal.
I heard from Federal employees,
more than 4,200 of whom I am proud to
represent in Congress, who worried
about losing their dental and vision in-
surance.
I met with members of the U.S. Coast
Guard, the only military personnel who
went without pay during the shutdown.
And I heard from small business own-
ers, more than 27,000 of whom live in
my district, about the effect of the
shutdown on their bottom lines.
All of this for what purpose?
From day one, I joined any col-
leagues in vote after vote to reopen the
government on a bipartisan basis.
It is incumbent on Congress to en-
sure that the government remains open
when the current spending package ex-
pires on February 15.
The border wall is a monument to di-
vision that, according to experts, is in-
effective and wasteful. Holding the
government hostage over it was wrong.
Indeed, not a single Member of the
House body—Democrat or Republican—
representing a border district is for the
construction of a wall.
When discussing the need for im-
proved border security, we must move
past fear-driven partisan politics which
seek only to divide us and paralyze our
democracy. Moreover, we cannot allow
ourselves to fall short of our constitu-
tional obligation as Members of Con-
gress.
Let us not forget that our Founding
Fathers began with the legislative
body in Article I of our Constitution.
This is the one body that represents
the will of the people, legislatively.
Our work should not be contingent
upon the whims and desires of another
branch of government meant to only
execute the laws our body is obliged to
legislate. This is not how to preserve a
democratic order anchored in the sepa-
ration of powers and sustained by
healthy checks and balances.
To be clear, now is not the time to
run away from our responsibility as a
coequal branch of government. Demo-
crats and Republicans, alike, need to
come together and have an evidence-
based and transparent debate on the
question of border security, have a
vote, and then send legislation to the
President. It shouldn’t take a costly
shutdown and a threat of another
looming one in order to accomplish
this.
As Members of both parties from
both Houses begin budget negotiations
in a conference committee, I ask that
they remember the hardships endured
in recent weeks not only by the Fed-
eral employees who went without pay
in upstate New York, but also by busi-
ness owners, farmers, and so many oth-
ers in our region who were harmed be-
cause of ripple effects of the shutdown.
The government must not close
again. My district and our country
can’t afford another shutdown. It is our
collective responsibility to ensure we
do not find ourselves on February 15 at
the start of yet another shutdown.
In short, I urge this body to do as en-
visioned by our Founding Fathers, get
to work, and do our job.

IN RECOGNITION OF COLONEL
PETER NEZAMIS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. BOST) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Colonel Peter Nezamis of
Belleville.
It was recently announced that Colo-
nel Nezamis will be promoted to briga-
dier general and will lead the Illinois
Air National Guard, where he will lead
over 3,000 personnel.
He commanded the Air National
Guard’s 126th Air Refueling Wing at
Scott Air Force Base, which received
the Outstanding Unit Award, under his
guidance.
Colonel Nezamis has commanded nu-
merous expeditionary operations and
flew over 275 combat and combat sup-
port hours. He first joined the Air Na-
tional Guard in 1986 and has served our
State and Nation over 30 years.
Colonel Nezamis, we know you will
serve the State and Nation to the best
of your ability, and congratulations in
your new role.
ENHANCING AGRICULTURAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR
MILITARY VETERANS
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I also rise to
bring awareness about a coming crisis
in our Nation’s agricultural workforce.
According to USDA, the average age
for a farmer is now 58 and has been on
the rise for over 30 years. Our Nation
faces a shortfall of 700,000 agricultural
workers over the next 20 years.
How can we reverse this trend? Ac-
cording to the Department of Labor, 45
percent of armed servicemembers are
from rural America. Many of our re-
turning heroes struggle to find employ-
ment after serving our Nation.
Agriculture is a sensible solution to
fill the economic gap our veterans face.
That is why I joined with my friend
and colleague on the House Agriculture
Committee, AL LAWSON of Florida, to
introduce the Vets to Ag Act. Our bill
streamlines the process for veterans
getting apprenticeships in the agricul-
tural industry.
Despite dysfunction in Washington,
we are still fighting for bipartisan,
commonsense solutions to help our
farmers and our veterans. I encourage
my colleagues to support this bipar-
tisan effort.
HUMAN TRAFFICKING PREVENTION MONTH
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I also rise
today in recognition of Human Traf-
ficking and Prevention Month.
Human trafficking cases are on the
rise nationwide. As the grandfather of
11 grandchildren, I am angry about
that. My appreciation goes out to
members of law enforcement who are
on the front lines combating these
crimes and making our communities
safer.
Programs like the Department of
Homeland Security Blue Campaign
help combat human trafficking. The
program works to make sure, if traf-
ficking victims are taken over the bor-
der, they are rescued or have a re-
source that they can turn to for help.
These are important steps, but there
is still so much more work remaining.
Both parties must work together to do
our part in wiping out this evil before
it does any more harm.

STUDENT LOAN DEBT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Utah (Mr. CURTIS) for 5 minutes.
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I am
pleased to introduce the Transparency
in Student Lending Act.
College education can be a life-
changing investment, but it can come
at a tremendous cost. Right now, 44
million Americans collectively hold
$1.5 trillion in student loan debt. The
Federal Government lends 90 percent of
these dollars. However, unlike other
lenders, the Federal Government does
not provide students with complete in-
formation about the total cost of their
loan, leaving borrowers unaware of hid-
den costs and fees until they enter the
repayment phase. I have introduced
this bill to require complete informa-
tion be provided to students before
they take out a loan.
Mr. Speaker, I represent the young-

VENEZUELA
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. DIAZ-BALART) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker,
today I rise to call on all of those who
support freedom and democracy to
stand with the long-suffering people of
Venezuela. We have finally reached the
tipping point where freedom for the
Venezuelan people hangs in the bal-
ance.
On Friday, President Trump recog-
nized the duly elected leader of the Na-
tional Assembly, Juan Guaido, as the
constitutional interim President of
Venezuela. Shortly afterward the vast
majority of Western Hemisphere na-
tions affirmed their recognition of the
Guaido government.
On January 10 the OAS passed a reso-
lution, Mr. Speaker, that refused to
recognize the illegitimate Maduro re-
gime, and OAS Secretary-General Luis

January 29, 2019
Almagro expressed his congratulations
to Mr. Guaido as Venezuela’s legiti-
mate sitting President.
Now, Mr. Speaker, it is time to
choose to stand with the courageous
protesters demanding freedom, many of
them bruised and bloodied from the vi-
olence perpetrated on them by the
Maduro thugs. Reports indicate that at
least 29 protesters have been killed just
since last week, and the Maduro regime
holds hundreds of political prisoners.
The Maduro regime has ruthlessly cor-
rupted Venezuela’s once-democratic in-
stitutions, including the Supreme
Court.
The U.N. High Commissioner of
Human Rights and others have docu-
mented egregious human rights abuses,
extrajudicial killings, arbitrary deten-
tions, and torture. We have seen that
the Venezuelan people continue to de-
mand freedom in the face of teargas,
imprisonment, and, yes, even bullets.
The United States is standing with
the Venezuelan people, sanctioning 65
of the most corrupt and abusive mem-
bers of the Maduro regime, including
Maduro himself. Congress and the ad-
ministration are also working to al-
leviate the grave humanitarian crisis
that the Maduro regime has caused,
providing nearly $100 million in hu-
manitarian aid to those Venezuelans
who have fled to other countries and an
additional $37 million in development
assistance to Colombia.
Earlier this year, my colleague, Con-
gressman DARREN SOTO, and I worked
together to introduce the Venezuela
TPS Act of 2019 which would provide
Temporary Protective Status to Ven-
ezuelan nationals here in the United
States. The situation in Venezuela is
way too dangerous to force them to re-
turn now.
Sadly, Mr. Speaker, the humani-
tarian crisis rivals the grave demo-
cratic crisis in Venezuela. Under Ven-
ezuela’s socialism, its people are suf-
fering skyrocketing inflation, profound
destitution, and shortages of necessary
food and medicine.
Venezuela was once, just recently,
one of the wealthiest countries in the
world. Now the vast majority of Ven-
ezuelan people have sunk into poverty.
Hospitals are abandoned, Mr. Speaker,
and food and medicines are scarce. But,
Mr. Speaker, we have entered a time of
critical importance. Rarely is there
such an obvious choice between good
and evil, freedom and enslavement, and
accountable government and tyranny.
From Venezuela’s one last vestige of
democracy came a glimmer of hope.
From the democratically elected Na-
tional Assembly, a leader emerged who
was courageous enough to lead the op-
position and face certain persecution.
Juan Guaido stepped up to represent
the Venezuelan people and work with
the international community toward a
democratic transition to unite the
many voices in the opposition behind a
common purpose: freedom, human
rights, and free and fair elections.
He has designated his charge d’af-
faires here in the United States, Carlos
Vecchio, whose leadership was wel-
comed by Secretary Pompeo and who is
coordinating between the Guaido gov-
ernment and the United States Govern-
ment.
Already as President Guaido is gain-
ing strength, we are seeing signs of
cracks from the Maduro dictatorship.
The United States must continue to be
the world leader in defense of those
struggling for democracy, and others in
the world community who value free-
dom also must stand with the people of
Venezuela in their quest for democ-
racy.
Mr. Speaker, the people of Eastern
Europe have not forgotten that we
stood with them during those decades
in their struggle against Communism
for decades. They were victorious; and
today they are free, and they are allies.
The people of Venezuela will also be
victorious.
(The English translation of the state-
ment made in Spanish is as follows:)
To the Venezuelan Armed Forces, this is
the time to recover your honor, to recover
your dignity and stand with the Venezuelan
people in this noble cause, which is freedom.
And to the brave Venezuelan people, you
are not alone. The Trump administration,
the United States Congress, the United
States is with you.
A las Fuerzas Armadas de Venezuela, este
es el momento de recuperar su honor, de
recuperar su dignidad y ponerse de lado del
pueblo Venezolano en esta noble causa que es
la libertad.
Y al valiente pueblo Venezolano, no están

RECOGNIZING CAPTAIN JOHN
HEARN
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5
minutes.
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize a law enforce-
ment official who was recently named
Police Chief of Newtown Township in
Bucks County, Pennsylvania.
Earlier this month, Newtown Town-
ship’s Board of Supervisors unani-
mously supported Philadelphia Police
Department Captain John Hearn to be-
come the next police chief. John, a
Northampton Township resident, is a
29-year veteran of the Philadelphia Po-
lice Department. He previously served
as a lieutenant in that department’s
highway patrol, helping to escort dig-
nitaries such as Pope Francis and
former Presidents Barack Obama and
George W. Bush.
Throughout his esteemed career,
John distinguished himself as an inno-
vative leader. He represented Philadel-
phia when five neighboring counties es-
tablished protocol and a coordinated
response to terrorist threats, and he
served as a volunteer with fire compa-
nies in Montgomery County.
Mr. Speaker, we congratulate John
on his new role, and I look forward to
working closely with him to keep our
Bucks County families safe.
RECOGNIZING OFFICERS MEGAN KLOSTERMAN
AND GINA FERZETTI
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize members of our
law enforcement community who re-
cently joined our Bucks County family
as members of the Solebury Township
Police Department.
Earlier this month, Officers Megan
Klosterman and Gina Ferzetti were
sworn in by Magisterial District Judge
Maggie Snow as the department’s first
full-time female officers.
Officer Klosterman is a graduate of
Upper Dublin High School and Pennsyl-
vania State University. Officer Ferzetti
is a graduate of Ridley High School and
previously served with the Temple Uni-
versity Police Department. Both of
these dedicated public servants served
as part-time members of Solebury
Township Police Department prior to
their full instatement.
Mr. Speaker, I applaud Officers
Klosterman and Ferzetti on their pro-
motions and their dedication to keep-
ing all of our families safe in our com-
munity. Their hiring is truly an inspir-
ing moment for Solebury Township and
for Bucks County.
I would also like to thank Police
Chief Dominick Bellizzie and Township
Manager Dennis Carney for their lead-
ership.
RECOGNIZING JULIE UCHITEL
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize a student from
Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who was
recently awarded a coveted scholarship
to study in the United Kingdom.
Julie Uchitel, a resident of Upper
Southampton, was selected to receive a
Marshall Scholarship, one of only 40 re-
cipients out of over 1,000 applicants.
Julie is a senior at Duke University
where she is a neuroscience and French
double major. She is the president of
the Neuroscience Majors’ Union at
Duke and has conducted clinical and
basic pediatric research at The Chil-
dren’s Hospital of Philadelphia and
Duke Children’s Hospital. She is the
author of two published articles and
has volunteered in Paris and in Hon-
duras to offer medical assistance to
those in need.
Mr. Speaker, Julie’s resume is too
voluminous to summarize. We are so
proud to have her as part of our com-
munity, and we wish her all the best as
she pursues her studies at Cambridge
and King’s College in London. I look
forward to seeing all of her accomplish-
ments in the years to come.

The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the

lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

EQUALITY BETWEEN MEN AND
WOMEN
(Ms. GABBARD asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. GABBARD. Madam Speaker, it
has been nearly 100 years since women
fought for and won the right to vote.
Yet, we still do not have equal rights
and protection under the United States
Constitution.
There are too many examples in our
everyday lives where women still do
not get equal pay for equal work and
where we still face discrimination sim-
ply for being women.
In 1923, the Equal Rights Amendment
was introduced in Congress to prohibit
discrimination on the basis of sex and
was reintroduced every session until it
finally passed in 1972.
However, with an arbitrary deadline
in 1982, by that time, only 35 States out
of the required 38 had ratified the
amendment. In the past 2 years, we
have inched forward with successful
votes in Nevada and Illinois, and now
we are just one State away from finally
passing the Equal Rights Amendment.
This is not about politics. It is about
equality. It is about humanity. It is
long overdue that we pass the Equal
Rights Amendment and include equal-
ity between men and women in the
United States Constitution.
f
JANUARY IS NATIONAL
MENTORING MONTH
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize
the incredible role mentors play in the
lives of young people.
January is National Mentoring
Month, which brings national atten-
tion to the need for mentors. Individ-
uals, businesses, government agencies,
schools, faith communities, and non-
profits can all engage their constitu-
ents to become mentors for the next
generation of leaders.
When children have strong role mod-
els in their lives, they grow up to be
good neighbors and good citizens. As a
co-chairman of the Congressional Ca-
reer and Technical Education Caucus, I
know firsthand how essential mentors
are for students seeking a career in
technical education.
From agriculture to the arts, from
marketing to manufacturing, CTE pro-
grams work to develop America’s most
valuable resources: its people. CTE has
established itself as a path that many
high-achieving students choose in pur-
suit of industry certification and
hands-on skills that they can use right
out of high school, in skills-based edu-
cation programs or in our colleges.
Many CTE instructors are mentors
who inspire students to reach their full
potential and follow their dreams
wherever they may lead.
Mr. Speaker, I thank every mentor in
America for providing students the
guidance and confidence that they need
to find success.
f
WORK TOGETHER TO KEEP
GOVERNMENT OPEN
(Ms. PELOSI asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
call attention to the fact that so
many—800,000—Federal workers were
out of work when the government was
shut down, and now, happily, they will
be back at work. Soon, all of them will
be getting a paycheck.
This was very sad for their families,
very sad for their communities where
their financial viability is important,
and very sad for our economy. Happily,
the government is reopened, but not
without paying a price.
I was very pleased that last week, on
Thursday, so many Members came to
the floor to tell the stories of the fami-
lies affected by the shutdown, and then
we had a Special Order and people
sought comfort in the fact that we
were recognizing the value that our
public employees add to our economy
and also concern for their well-being.
I want to tell one story that I
thought was just so remarkable. Yes-
terday, I went to help with meals for
the families who still have not gotten a
paycheck. Even though government is
open, it will be a couple of more days.
While I was there, I met a woman who
seemed young to me, but I guess she
must have been middle-aged. They told
me, after I was with her for a while,
that, on Friday, she would be going to
hospice, but it was a comfort to her to
spend her last days before hospice feed-
ing the hungry, having empathy for
those who had that uncertainty in
their lives.
What a blessing she is. Let us all
have that empathy for those who are
placed in that financial insecurity, and
let us work to keep government open,
to come to agreement so it can resolve
all doubt in anyone’s mind that that is
not a reasonable path, to seek agree-
ment holding hostage our public em-
ployees.
We thank them for what they do for
our country. We sympathize with
them. At this time, we are happy that
government is open. Let’s work to-
gether to keep it so.
f
THANKING ROBERT COLBY HALE
FOR HIS SERVICE
(Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I would
like to take this time to recognize and
thank a friend and confidant who has
been by my side for the last 15 years.
I first met my chief of staff, Robert
Colby Hale, when he was 22 years old. I
was the commencement speaker at his
graduation ceremony at Hardin-Sim-
mons University, and he introduced me
on stage.
In that moment, I never imagined so
many years later our paths would take
us to the Texas secretary of state’s of-
fice in Austin and now to the U.S.
House of Representatives.
I gave Colby his first job and watched
him grow from a recent college grad-
uate into the husband, father, and pro-
fessional that he is today.
He has been my right-hand man since
before I decided to run for Congress in
2012. He believed in me, and he encour-
aged me every single day.
There is no one’s counsel that I have
trusted more. Colby will be missed
around our office, but he is leaving his
legacy in the capable hands of those he
trained and those he mentored.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 25th
Congressional District of Texas and the
United States Congress, I thank Mr.
Colby Hale. I thank him for his years

f
FIND BALANCE BETWEEN LEGITI-
MATE TRADE AND TOURISM AT
BORDER
(Mr. CUELLAR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I live on
the border, and we have to understand
that, every day, there is about $1.3 bil-
lion of trade between the U.S. and Mex-
ico. That is a lot of jobs that are being
created on this side.
When you look at the Mexicans who
come over and shop, one out of every
four international tourists will be peo-
ple from across the river. That is over
$20 billion that is spent on the U.S. side
in hotels, restaurants, and many other
places. Those are jobs over here.
We want to see strong border secu-
rity, but, again, we have to make sure
that we find the balance between le-
gitimate trade and tourism. The way
to do that is to look at technology that
has worked for the military that can
work for us on the border and hire the
right number of Border Patrol and CBP
officers. If we do that, we can find a
way to find the balance between legiti-
mate trade and tourism, and I ask you
to please consider that as we debate
border security.
f
SECURE OUR BORDERS
(Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, the
Federal Government has fully re-
opened, and Federal employees are
back to work. While the shutdown is
over, the crisis at the border remains.
I recently toured the southern border
in Arizona. Ranchers and Border Patrol
agents told me about the challenges
they face because of open borders. I
saw short, weak, barbwire fences that
line our border. I learned more about
violent cartels and how they profit
from our porous borders, from human
trafficking and the flooding of drugs
into our communities.
Congress has an obligation to secure
our border. We must give Border Patrol
agents the tools they need to get their
job done. They told me they need
equipment to detect drugs, and more
and better body armor.
Border Patrol agents also told me
that they need a wall. They know walls
work. Congress should listen to them.
Tomorrow, the conference committee
tasked with border security will meet
for the first time. Having seen the bor-
der crisis firsthand, I urge those law-
makers to listen to our Border Patrol
agents, fund meaningful physical bar-
riers, and secure our borders.
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN HURTS
THE PEOPLE
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, fortu-
nately, the United States Government
is open, and, fortunately, when Donald
Trump comes to this Chamber on Feb-
ruary 5, he can say the state of the
Union is that the government is open.
Otherwise, the State of the Union
would have been different.
A lot of people lost paychecks and
had great difficulties because of 35 days
without many Federal employees get-
ting paid. That should not happen
again.
A lot of private entrepreneurs whose
businesses are located near Federal fa-
cilities will never recover the losses.
When Federal employees did not go to
work, people who have grocery stores,
cafeterias, and lunchrooms lost busi-
ness that they can never make up.
The ability of the FAA to keep our
airlines going was jeopardized. We
don’t need to let that happen again.
That hurts commerce and hurts our
country.
We need to have an agreement, but
we don’t need to build an unnecessary
fifth-century wall. George Bush put up
more barriers than any other Presi-
dent, but none in Texas, his home
State, because the Rio Grande River is
the dividing point. There is a big dif-
ference.
God bless WALTER JONES.
f
A PATH FOR PROGRESS IN WAR
ON POVERTY
(Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker,
since LBJ launched the War on Pov-
erty, the percentage of Americans liv-
ing below the poverty line has re-
mained persistently static.
As reform efforts in Congress con-
tinue to falter, American’s poverty re-
duction efforts continue to fall short of
their objectives. We need a different
approach to help millions of Americans
escape poverty.
Today, I am introducing the People
Centered Assistance Reform Effort Act,
or the People CARE Act. This legisla-
tion creates a bipartisan commission in
order to empower caseworkers to treat
each person holistically, rather than
simply administer programs; realign
the 90-plus, often duplicative, poverty
programs; remove benefit cliffs; and
more.
It encourages employment, marriage,
and education, activities identified by
the Brookings Institution and others
as effective means to end poverty.
The commission cannot launch new
programs, nor directly cut spending.
Upon receiving the commission’s rec-
ommendation, Congress would have to
vote to approve or disapprove.
People CARE offers a path for
progress in the War on Poverty. Mr.
Speaker, I encourage all of my col-
leagues to cosponsor the People CARE
Act.

GOOD LEADERSHIP
(Mr. GOLDEN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. GOLDEN. Mr. Speaker, today I
am introducing a commonsense, bipar-
tisan bill with Congressman CRENSHAW
and Congressman ROSE. It is called the
Solidarity in Salary Act. It is a simple
bill that says if Federal employees
aren’t getting paychecks because of a
shutdown, Members of Congress and
the President shouldn’t get their pay-
checks.
People back in Maine have heard me
talk about when I was a young private
first class joining my unit in the Ma-
rines at mealtime out in the field when
they brought a hot meal out, we had a
simple rule that we followed. What we
would do is the private first class and
lance corporal would go first to eat fol-
lowed by the NCOs and staff NCOs,
after that, the officers.
The idea was that good leaders
should take care of other people before
stopping and thinking about them-
selves. That is the principle behind this
bill.
Mr. Speaker, I would urge my col-
leagues to join Congressmen CRENSHAW
and ROSE and me in supporting this
legislation.
f
SECURE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER
(Mr. WALBERG asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, over
the past month, we saw President
Trump put forward one offer after an-
other to secure our southern border.
They were reasonable offers that
sought common ground, but every step
of the way, Speaker PELOSI was unwill-
ing to participate in any type of good-
faith negotiations.
Now the President has given the
Democrats yet another opportunity.
The government is fully reopened and
workers are receiving their paychecks.
We can all agree that that is a good
thing, but we still need a long-term so-
lution to address the humanitarian cri-
sis at our southern border. We need
more technology, more border agents,
and more physical barriers.
Now is the time for Speaker PELOSI
to stop stonewalling. Let’s get serious
about negotiating a deal. Let’s make
sure our southern border is secure, and
let’s make sure our citizens are safe.
That is what the American people want
us to do, and it is time to get it done.

minute and to revise and extend his re-

Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to raise awareness of a plague affecting
our Nation and our world. It is called
human trafficking. There are more
than 40 million victims worldwide, and
it happens in our backyards right here
in congressional districts throughout
the country. My district, because of
the geographic location in California’s
Central Valley, sees a disproportion-
ately high amount of human traf-
ficking that takes place.
Fighting this atrocity requires all of
us to come together with a comprehen-
sive strategy. Organizations like
Breaking the Chains in my district are
needed to support survivors. Law en-
forcement needs to hold perpetrators
accountable.
This week as the co-chairs of the bi-
partisan Congressional Victims’ Rights
Caucus, Congressman PETE OLSON and I
are introducing a resolution in the
House to support the observation of
National Slavery and Human Traf-
ficking Prevention Month. It is sad
that we have to bring this kind of rec-
ognition, but it is the reality.
This resolution calls for the Federal
Government to coordinate its efforts
and fight human trafficking between
agencies and State and local govern-
ments as well as other organizations.
We in the Congressional Victims’
Rights Caucus will continue to lead
and push this effort. We need to work
together.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF CLEBERN H. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SHOWS,
JR.
(Mr. PALAZZO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life and legacy of
Clebern H. ‘‘Bobby’’ Shows, Jr. who
passed away on January 20 of this year
at the age of 80. I send my condolences
and prayers to Bobby’s wife of 42 years,
Sandra, as well as his family and
friends.
Born and raised in Mississippi, he
was a graduate of USM. During his life
he worked as a cattle farmer, business-
man, and public servant.
I had the distinct honor to serve
alongside Bobby in the Mississippi
House and knew him as a friend. Bobby
was first elected to the Mississippi
House of Representatives in 1992 and
served the community of Ellisville for
24 years. He was well-known by his col-
leagues in the State legislature as a
principled conservative and served as
chairman of the County Affairs Com-
mittee. Throughout his time in office,
Chairman Shows earned his reputation
as a strong advocate for Mississippi’s
rural residents.
Although we are sad to hear of his
passing, we take comfort in his exam-
ple of a life well-lived and the legacy
he leaves behind. On behalf of the
Fourth Congressional District of Mis-
sissippi, we honor the memory of
Bobby Shows, a loving husband, father,
man of God, and a dedicated civil serv-
ant.
f
HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY
2019
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, this past weekend, the world
paused to commemorate International
Holocaust Remembrance Day. Millions
of Jews were mercilessly killed as part
of what the Nazis called their final so-
lution to the Jewish problem. This hap-
pened just 74 years ago, though many
seem to forget.
From the ashes, Jewish people re-
turned to their ancient homeland and
established a dynamic democracy in
the Middle East. Unfortunately, the
Jewish people of Israel are again tar-
gets of extermination. Just yesterday,
the deputy head of the Islamic Revolu-

Israel from the global political map.
We must honor the memories of the 6
million murdered by Nazis by vowing
that Jews will never again be threat-
ened with extermination. The Amer-

SECURE THE SOUTHERN BORDER
(Mr. GRIFFITH asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate all who have been here today giv-
ing speeches.
The government shutdown is now
over, but the crisis continues on the
border. About 10 days ago, I was down
on the border, and I saw firsthand what
was happening down there and talked
to people who were down there.
So, hopefully, during this time pe-
riod, because the Democrats said re-
peatedly that if we reopen the govern-
ment they would negotiate, hopefully
we can negotiate and come to a bipar-
tisan resolution that will help us to se-
cure our southern border and continue
to work on other ways that we can im-
prove our immigration process.

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that
all Members may have 5 legislative
days to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous mate-
rials on this measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Mississippi?
There was no objection.
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
424, the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity Clearance Management and Ad-
ministration Act.
Mr. Speaker, before I begin, let me
say I am pleased that we have reached
the end of the longest government
shutdown in U.S. history. I am grateful
to the women and men of DHS and
their families for their professionalism
during this difficult month. We should
all recognize that they continue to
serve our country every day by keeping
our citizens safe.
Mr. Speaker, I have reintroduced
H.R. 424, the Department of Homeland
Security Clearance Management and
Administration Act, to reform how the
department manages its security clear-
ance processes. It is no secret that the
security clearance process is in dire
need of change.
Since September 11, there has been
massive growth in the amount of clas-
sified material across the Federal Gov-
ernment. In many cases, material is
over-classified where it is kept at a
higher classification level or at a high-
er classification level for longer than
needed. The explosion in the number of
Federal positions requiring security
clearances has driven an enormous
backlog in security clearance back-
ground investigations.
As of last Congress, the average wait-
ing period for an initial background
check for a top-secret clearance was 390
days—more than a year. The average
waiting period for a reinvestigation of
an individual holding a top-secret
clearance was 518 days—nearly 11⁄2
years.
The delays caused by this enormous
backlog represent very real barriers to
employment and promotion within
government. Many individuals with
clearances do not actually need clear-
ances to do their jobs. According to a
2014 report by the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget, 40 percent of all indi-
viduals with clearances did not even
have access to classified information as
part of their work.
Misclassification of national security
positions is not only wasteful of gov-
ernment resources but creates needless
barriers to entry and advancement.
Clearly, the clearance system is in des-
perate need of significant reform.
H.R. 424 would help put DHS on a
path to rightsizing its ranks by ensur-
ing that national security positions are
properly designated.
H.R. 424 would also require DHS to
conform, from time to time, that its
security designations are still appro-
priate. This would ensure that the de-
partment is not needlessly limiting the
applicant pool for positions that do not
require access to classified informa-
tion.
While the executive branch is explor-
ing ways to improve the way in which
positions are designated for clearances,
H.R. 424 would allow DHS to become a
leader in modernizing and streamlining
this system.
Finally, H.R. 424 would require DHS
to keep applicants’ and employees’ per-
sonal information safe from data
breaches.
Taken together, these reforms rep-
resent progress toward fixing the bro-
ken clearance system. It will save DHS
money, time, and other resources by
streamlining the clearance and des-
ignation systems.
Fundamentally, enactment of H.R.
424 would begin to break down barriers
to employment and promotion that
prevent Federal employees from ad-
vancing in their careers.
With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge the
passage of H.R. 424, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
424, the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity Clearance Management and Ad-
ministration Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1256 January 29, 2019
President Trump has directed a
major security clearance and back-
ground information overhaul across
the executive branch. This effort is un-
derway, and significant progress has
been made to reduce the backlog and
improve the quality of background in-
vestigations. The bill we are consid-
ering today complements this initia-
tive.
H.R. 424 requires the Secretary of
Homeland Security to conduct an in-
ventory of the department’s positions
that require security clearances, which
currently number over 100,000, and de-
termine what positions may be duplica-
tive or are no longer necessary. It is
just good government to periodically
review the positions that require a
‘‘need to know’’ and to ensure DHS is
not allocating funds for unnecessary
background investigations. Security
clearances are costly to investigate,
adjudicate, and maintain.
The bill would ensure that DHS con-
ducts a thorough accounting of its
workforce needs and reduces the num-
ber of positions with security clear-
ances if determined appropriate. The
bill would also require additional
transparency on how security clear-
ances are adjudicated, including when
there are reasons to suspend or deny a
security clearance.
Chairman THOMPSON’s legislation is
an example of the accounting that each
Federal department should be con-
ducting today and would lead to a lean-
er and more secure Department of
Homeland Security.
Mr. Speaker, the bill is identical to
the version the House passed last Con-
gress, and I would just reiterate this is
good government, bipartisan legisla-
tion. I urge its support, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
b 1230
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, H.R. 424, which passed by
voice vote in the last Congress, will
help improve critical aspects of DHS’
security clearance process.
The truth is that not every position
requires a clearance, not every docu-
ment needs to be classified. Our intel-
ligence and law enforcement officials
should focus their limited time and re-
sources on protecting materials that
are truly sensitive. Access to those ma-
terials should be granted carefully and
appropriately to individuals who actu-
ally need to handle those materials.
Enactment of H.R. 424 would not only
make DHS a leader in this space, but it
would help break down barriers to em-
ployment and growth within the De-
partment. Mr. Speaker, I ask for my
colleagues’ support, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
COHEN). The question is on the motion
offered by the gentleman from Mis-
sissippi (Mr. THOMPSON) that the House
suspend the rules and pass the bill,
H.R. 424.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that
all Members have 5 legislative days to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on this
measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Mississippi?
There was no objection.
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
495, the FIRST State and Local Law
Enforcement Act.
I thank my Democratic colleague,
Ms. JACKSON LEE, for reintroducing
this measure in the new Congress.
H.R. 495 would require DHS to submit
an annual report to Congress on the ac-
tivities of the Office for State and
Local Law Enforcement.
This bill was written, informed by a
report I had my staff prepare to look at
DHS’ progress at implementing the 9/11
Commission Act on its 10th anniver-
sary in 2017. The report recommended
that DHS continuously refine its infor-
mation-sharing networks.
Central to this effort is the Depart-
ment’s engagement with State and
local law enforcement. Specifically,
H.R. 495 requires an annual report that
highlights the activities of this office.
Pursuant to H.R. 495, each report
must contain detailed information on
existing programs and performance
metrics to evaluate their effectiveness.
More importantly, each report must in-
clude feedback received from these law
enforcement agencies so that future
collaboration can be meaningful.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this legislation, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
495, the Office of State and Local Law
Enforcement Information Sharing Re-
view Act, introduced by my friend and
colleague, the gentlewoman from
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE).
The Office for State and Local Law
Enforcement is part of the Department
of Homeland Security and currently re-
sides in the Office of Partnership and
Engagement. The Office provides infor-
mation on DHS’ resources that are
available to State and local law en-
forcement agency partners and a point
of contact for questions regarding
DHS’ policies and programs.
This bill requires the Office for State
and Local Law Enforcement to provide
a report on the efforts of the Office to
improve information sharing between
DHS and law enforcement agencies, an
overview of the performance metrics
used to measure success and any feed-
back provided by the State and local
stakeholders, and an overview of ongo-
ing activities of the Office.
This reporting requirement is in-
tended to assist the Office in identi-
fying areas of improvement in the De-
partment’s information-sharing efforts
and coordinating with the relevant
DHS components to close any identi-
fied gaps.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1257
January 29, 2019
I am pleased the bill includes a sun-
set on the reporting requirement after
5 years. While the information gath-
ered through the report will be valu-
able for congressional oversight, it is
important that we do not overburden
the Department with never-ending re-
porting requirements.
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support this measure, and I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON
LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker,
allow me to thank the chairman for fa-
cilitating this bill to the floor and the
support of our ranking member, Mr.
ROGERS, for this legislation and the
work that we do on the Committee on
Homeland Security.
Mr. Speaker, before I start, allow me
to acknowledge, with my thoughts and
prayers, the wounded officers and
members of the Houston Police Depart-
ment who were shot last evening in a
senseless shooting. Four of the officers
were shot in the attempt to render a
drug warrant, and one was injured. I
understand, of that group, there were
several who are in critical condition.
Thanks to the professional work of
the Houston Police Department, two of
the persons perpetrating this crime
have been stopped, and I hope the fami-
lies of the victim police officers take
comfort in the knowledge that every-
one in our community—and, yes, in our
Nation—is praying for the speedy and
complete recovery of each of the offi-
cers wounded, injured in this terrible
tragedy.
It is because of the importance of law
enforcement in the communication
with the Department of Homeland Se-
curity that I reintroduced H.R. 495 to
require the Department of Homeland
Security’s Office for State and Local
Law Enforcement to report annually
on its activities.
As we all know, after the September
11 terrorist attacks, our Nation learned
that the inability of Federal, State,
local, Tribal, and territorial partners
to share information was a critical
failure in our national security appa-
ratus. Those of us who happened to be
in the United States Congress at that
time saw that as this heinous act was
occurring. It was the first responders,
local law enforcement, who all con-
verged on Ground Zero.
Today, I am proud to say that there
has been real progress on closing this
once-prominent information-sharing
gap. It is now commonplace within the
Federal Government to support poli-
cies that empower and include our
State and local partners. I can assure
you, Mr. Speaker, it is because of the
work of the Members of the United
States Congress—in particular, mem-
bers of the Committee on Homeland
Security—who gradually built this
pathway that is so crucial.
I hear it often from my local law en-
forcement, the importance of commu-
nicating via a two-way street—classi-
fied, confidential—with officials in the
Federal Government.
To keep DHS on that path, H.R. 495
requires the Assistant Director of the
DHS office in charge of coordinating,
liaising, and advocating for State and
local law enforcement to submit an an-
nual report to Congress on its work. It
is important because we in Congress
are the watchdogs to insist upon that
cooperation.
Requiring this report will not only
provide metrics to assess the effective-
ness of the Office’s current work, but it
would include comprehensive informa-
tion on existing programs and feedback
from law enforcement agencies them-
selves. Remember, they are, every day,
on the front lines. They are the first
responders to see something and say
something as relates to protecting us
against terrorism.
More, this measure would ensure fu-
ture accountability of the Department
and its work with local partners.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from
Texas an additional 1 minute.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. It is no secret
that the threat landscape of today is
constantly evolving. What we have
learned from this challenge is there
must be proactive measures in place at
all levels of the government to track
the growth of and reflect upon our ca-
pabilities to combat crime and terror.
State and local law enforcement pro-
vide tireless work to investigate and
apprehend individuals of heinous
crime. It is our duty to ensure that
they are able to do their very best
work in collaboration with their Fed-
eral partners and keep our commu-
nities safe.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to
support this very important legisla-
tion, and I also ask for prayers not
only for those shot last night, but the
injured officers in my district who were
injured on Christmas Eve, one severely
burned—that is two officers, Officer
Daily and Officer Reid. We continue to
pray for Officer Daily, who suffered
burns all over his body.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 495,
the ‘‘FIRST State and Local Law Enforcement
Act.’’
Mr. Speaker. I want to take this time to ac-
knowledge the Houston police officers injured.
My thoughts and prayers are with the
wounded officers and the members of the
Houston Police Department.
The senseless shooting of four of Houston’s
finest and bravest last evening, while they
were serving a warrant, is a tragedy and an-
other reminder of the dangers faced by law
enforcement officers who risk their lives to
keep their communities safe. One officer in-
jured his knee. Totaling 5 officers hurt.
Thanks to the swift and professional police
work of the Houston Police Department, two of
the persons perpetrating this heinous crime
have been stopped.
I hope the families of the victims take com-
fort in the knowledge that everyone in our
community is praying for speedy and complete
recovery of each of the officers wounded in
this tragedy.
Mr. Speaker, I reintroduced H.R. 495 to re-
quire the Department of Homeland Security’s
Office for State and Local Law Enforcement to
report annually on its activities.
As we all know, after the September 11th
terrorist attacks our Nation learned that the in-
ability of the Federal, State, local, tribal and
territorial partners to share information was a
critical failure in our national security appa-
ratus.
Today, I am proud to say that there’s been
real progress in closing this once prominent
information sharing gap.
It is now common practice within the Fed-
eral government to support policies that em-
power and include our State and local part-
ners.
To keep DHS on that path, H.R. 495 re-
quires the Assistant Director of DHS’ Office in
charge of coordinating, liaising, and advo-
cating for state and local law enforcement to
submit an annual report to Congress on its
work.
Requiring this report would not only provide
metrics to assess the effectiveness of the of-
fice’s current work, but it would include com-
prehensive information on existing programs
and feedback from the law enforcement agen-
cies themselves.
More, this measure would ensure future ac-
countability of the Department and its work
with local partners.
It is no secret that the threat landscape of
today is constantly evolving.
What we have learned from this challenge is
that there must be proactive measure in place
at all levels of government to track the growth
of and reflect upon our capabilities to combat
crime and terror.
State and local law enforcement provide
tireless work to investigate and apprehend in-
dividuals of heinous crimes.
It is our duty to ensure that they are able to
do their best work in collaboration with their
Federal partners to keep our communities
safe.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 495, which passed the
House on suspension last Congress, requires
DHS’ Office of State and Local Law Enforce-
ment to produce an annual report.
This report documents the office’s coordina-
tion, liaison, and advocacy efforts for state and
local law enforcement.
Again, I have reintroduced this measure be-
cause I believe our national security is at its
best when the Federal government works to-
gether with our State and local partners.
With that, I urge my colleagues to support
H.R. 495.
I want to take this time to acknowledge the
service and fighting spirit of Houston Police
Officers John Daily and Alonzo Reid.
On Christmas Eve, Officers Daily and Reid
were responding, with lights on, to a call for
assistance from a fellow officer when they
were hit nearly head on.
Their patrol car rolled several times before
it collided with a pole and caught fire.
Thankfully, both survived the fiery car crash.
Officer Reid showed true heroism when he
pulled Officer Daily from the driver’s seat with
the assistance of a passer-by, Juan Carlos
Salgado.
Thankfully, Officer Reid was released from
the hospital on Christmas Day.

However, Officer Daily, who suffered burns
to over half his body, has endured five sur-
geries and is still in the hospital in serious
condition.
Officers Daily and Reid put service above
self every day, including on Christmas Eve
when they were on their way to offer assist-
ance to a fellow officer.
My thoughts and prayers are with Officer
Daily, his family, and fellow officers for a full
recovery.
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I reiterate, this is good government
policy, and I fully support and urge its
passage.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr.
Speaker, nearly 18 years after the Sep-
tember 11 attacks, it is important that
we stand together and recommit our-
selves to doing all we can to prevent
further terrorist attacks at the Fed-
eral, State, and local levels.
Enactment of H.R. 495, which passed
the House on suspension last Congress,
would help ensure that State and local
law enforcement know DHS is a full
partner in securing their communities.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support H.R. 495, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
speak in strong support of H.R. 495, the
FIRST State and Local Law Enforcement Act,
which supports the work of the Department of
Homeland Security’s Office of State and Local
Law Enforcement (OSLLE) by requiring that
an annual report of its activities be submitted
to Congress so that we can be aware of the
range of benefits and services needed by local
and state law enforcement agencies.
The work of law enforcement is rewarding to
those who serve, but it can also be very dan-
gerous.
My thoughts and prayers are with the
wounded officers and the members of the
Houston Police Department.
The senseless shooting of five of Houston’s
finest and bravest last evening, while they
were serving a warrant, is a tragedy and an-
other reminder of the dangers faced by law
enforcement officers who risk their lives to
keep their communities safe.
Thanks to the swift and professional police
work of the Houston Police Department, two of
the persons perpetrating this heinous crime
have been stopped.
I hope the families of the victims take com-
fort in the knowledge that everyone in our
community is praying for speedy and complete
recovery of each of the officers wounded in
this tragedy.
The basis for creating the office is one of 33
recommendations of the 9/11 Commission,
which called for a primary coordinator, liaison,
and advocate for state, local, tribal, and terri-
torial law enforcement agencies.
This legislation mandates that OSLLE also
leads the coordination of DHS’s policies re-
lated to state, local, tribal, and territorial law
enforcement’s role in preventing, preparing for,
protecting against, and responding to natural
disasters, acts of terrorism and other man-
made disasters.
As a member of the Committee on Home-
land Security, I am very much aware of the
importance of the work performed by the men
and women who protect us from terrorism.
Homeland Security is defined as:
‘‘the national effort to ensure a homeland
that is safe, secure, and resilient against ter-
rorism and other hazards where American in-
terests, aspirations, and ways of life can thrive
to the national effort to prevent terrorist at-
tacks within the United States, reduce the vul-
nerability of the U.S. to terrorism, and mini-
mize the damage from attacks that do occur’’
I am proud to have so many first responders
as friends, and I am committed to working tire-
lessly to assure that they have the full support
of Congress in getting the resources and train-
ing they need to protect our communities.
This bill will provide an important opportunity
for DHS to report on this vital work with state
and local law enforcement agencies.
The sacrifices made by our men and
women in state and local law enforcement all
too often go unnoticed.
One example of their heroism and bravery
was seen when Houston Police Officers
Alonzo Reid and John Daily were involved in
a Christmas Eve car crash.
On Christmas Eve, Officers Daily and Reid
were responding, with lights on, to a call for
assistance from a fellow officer when they
were hit nearly head on.
Their patrol car rolled several times before
it collided with a pole and caught fire.
Thankfully, both survived the fiery car crash.
Officer Reid showed true heroism when he
pulled Officer Daily from the driver’s seat with
the assistance of a passerby, Juan Carlos
Salgado.
Thankfully, Officer Reid was released from
the hospital on Christmas Day.
However, Officer Daily, who suffered burns
to over half his body, has endured five sur-
geries and is still in serious medical condition.
I ask my colleagues to join me in offering
prayers and well wishes to Officer Daily for a
fully recovery.
Officers Daily and Reid like tens of thou-
sands of their counter parts, put service above
self every day.
The Department of Homeland Security has
been in existence for 16 years, and in that
time the men and women who serve on the
front lines of defending the United States
against terrorist acts at home have not
wavered in their commitment.
During times of crisis, the relationships
among federal, state, and local law enforce-
ment agencies is proven to be of the greatest
value to an effective government wide re-
sponse.
On August 25, 2017, Hurricane Harvey
made landfall in Texas.
Local, state, and federal first responders
rescued 122,331 people.
The Coast Guard deployed 2,060 personnel,
50 aircraft, 75 boats and 29 cutters, rescuing
11,022 people and 1,384 pets.
FEMA deployed 28 Urban Search and Res-
cue (USAR) teams from across the nation to
Texas to assist state and local agencies with
the lifesaving mission.
This is in addition to the tens of thousands
of meals, water, supplies, and public assist-
ance that were also provided.
Hurricane Harvey’s Federal, state, and local
response agencies benefit from collaborating
with DHS.
Because the DHS office plays a significant
role in the required outreach to state and local
law enforcement entities it is important that the
Committee on Homeland Security be kept ap-
prised of its work.
Today, DHS is not funded due to the Trump
Shutdown.
It is shameful that 85 percent of DHS em-
ployees are either working with no paycheck
or have been furloughed.
These men and women work for Cybersecu-
rity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Cus-
toms and Border Protection, Citizenship and
Immigration Services, Federal Emergency
Management Agency, U.S. Coast Guard, Im-
migration and Customs Enforcement, Secret
Service, and Transportation and Security Ad-
ministration.
It has been reported that many DHS em-
ployees have described feeling depressed,
stressed out, anxious, uncomfortable, and in-
secure because of the Trump Shutdown.
It is time to end the Trump Shutdown.
This bill will need DHS fully staffed and
functioning to ensure that the reporting re-
quirement of this bill are fulfilled so that the
federal, state, and local agencies working with
DHS receive the support that they need.
For this reason, I ask that my colleagues
join me in voting for H.R. 495.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.
THOMPSON) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 495.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.

HOMELAND SECURITY ASSESS-
MENT OF TERRORISTS’ USE OF
VIRTUAL CURRENCIES ACT
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I move to suspend the rules and pass
the bill (H.R. 428) to direct the Under
Secretary of Homeland Security for In-
telligence and Analysis to develop and
disseminate a threat assessment re-
garding terrorist use of virtual cur-
rency.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 428
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Homeland
Security Assessment of Terrorists’ Use of
Virtual Currencies Act’’.
SEC. 2. THREAT ASSESSMENT ON TERRORIST USE
OF VIRTUAL CURRENCY.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 120 days
after the date of the enactment of this Act,
the Under Secretary of Homeland Security
for Intelligence and Analysis, as authorized
by section 201(b)(1) of the Homeland Security
Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 121(b)(1)), shall, in co-
ordination with appropriate Federal part-
ners, develop and disseminate a threat as-
sessment regarding the actual and potential
threat posed by individuals using virtual
currency to carry out activities in further-
ance of an act of terrorism, including the
provision of material support or resources to
a foreign terrorist organization. Consistent
with the protection of classified and con-
fidential unclassified information, the Under
Secretary shall share the threat assessment
developed under this section with State,
local, and tribal law enforcement officials,
including officials who operate within State,
local, and regional fusion centers through
the Department of Homeland Security State,
Local, and Regional Fusion Center Initiative
established in section 210A of the Homeland
Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 124h).
(b) DEFINITIONS.—In this section:
(1) The term ‘‘foreign terrorist organiza-
tion’’ means an organization designated as a
foreign terrorist organization under section
219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act
(8 U.S.C. 1189).
(2) The term ‘‘virtual currency’’ means a
digital representation of value that func-
tions as a medium of exchange, a unit of ac-
count, or a store of value.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from
New York (Miss RICE) and the gen-
tleman from Louisiana (Mr. HIGGINS)
each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York.
GENERAL LEAVE
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to
include extraneous material on this
measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York?
There was no objection.
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
428, the Homeland Security Assessment
of Terrorists’ Use of Virtual Currencies
Act.
In the 17 years since the deadliest
terrorist attack in American history,
the United States has led the global
fight against terrorism, thwarting
plots and preventing attacks on Amer-
ican soil, identifying and disrupting
terrorist networks around the world,
and hunting down terrorists wherever
they may hide.
However, the threat of terrorism is
not the same as it was on September
11, 2001. It is a threat that constantly
evolves, and we need to evolve with it.
We need to evolve ahead of it.
Today, we have to acknowledge that
the front lines of the war on terror are
shifting increasingly away from indi-
vidual countries and into cyberspace.
This new front line poses an especially
dangerous and nebulous threat when it
comes to terrorist financing.
As such, the Homeland Security As-
sessment of Terrorists’ Use of Virtual
Currencies Act speaks to a timely and
pressing concern. Over the past several
years, a number of terrorist organiza-
tions have turned to virtual currencies
to support themselves and fund their
operations.
For example, in December of 2017, a
woman in New York was arrested and
pled guilty after she obtained $62,000 in
bitcoin and other virtual currencies to
send to ISIL. Using those virtual funds,
she was able to send the money via
shell entities in Pakistan, China, and
Turkey that were fronts for ISIL.
In early 2017, Indonesian authorities
reported that a Syria-based Indonesian

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1260 January 29, 2019
with ties to ISIL used bitcoin and
other virtual currencies to fund at-
tacks in Indonesia.
The same things that make virtual
currencies appealing to everyday con-
sumers, speed and convenience, make
these currencies appealing to those
who want to finance illegal activities.
Many forms of virtual currencies also
offer their users anonymity, making
them particularly attractive to those
seeking to circumvent American law
enforcement and financial institutions.
In order to effectively confront this
threat, we need to fully understand it.
We need a comprehensive assessment
of how virtual currencies might be
abused for illegal and nefarious ends.
My bill would require DHS to con-
duct such an assessment and share its
findings with law enforcement officers
who are on the front lines of the war on
terror.
Indeed, this bill will help provide law
enforcement officials at all levels with
the 21st century solutions, informa-
tion, and resources they need to
counter this emerging threat.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my House col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and
colleague, Congresswoman RICE from
New York, for introducing this bill.
Over the past 12 months, there has
been growing concern by administra-
tion officials, as well as security and fi-
nancial experts, about potential
threats associated with
cryptocurrencies.
In July 2018, a Department of Justice
task force reported noted criminals are
using virtual currencies to collect,
hide, and launder funds, as well as pur-
chase illegal goods and services. Both
the Treasury Department and the In-
ternal Revenue Service have ongoing
efforts to review registered digital cur-
rency providers and identify illicit use.
The legislation we are considering
today, sponsored by the gentlewoman
from New York (Miss RICE), adds to
this effort by directing the Department
of Homeland Security to develop and
disseminate a threat assessment of
threat posed by individuals using vir-
tual currencies to carry out activities
in furtherance of terrorism, including
the provision of material support or re-
sources to a foreign terrorist organiza-
tion.
The bill also requires DHS to share
the threat assessment with State and
local law enforcement.
As the threat of terrorism evolves, so
do the methods to finance and support
the actors who plot to attack the
United States. The Federal Govern-
ment must evolve as well to meet these
novel and technologically based chal-
lenges.
This bill positions the Department to
detect the new, digital-based methods
in terrorist financing and support that
have already occurred and to prepare
for those that are sure and soon to fol-
low.
The potential of terrorist organiza-
tions to use virtual currencies to carry
out an attack, or a smuggling network
to launder illicit proceeds through
cryptocurrency markets, should be a
major concern to the Department of
Homeland Security. Requiring the De-
partment to conduct a threat assess-
ment is appropriate and timely.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman
RICE for bringing this bill forward, and
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 428 is an important
piece of legislation that was approved
by a voice vote last Congress. This bill
will help DHS effectively address ter-
rorists’ actual and potential use of vir-
tual currencies.
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues in the Freedom Caucus, who
care so much about national security
and domestic security, to put their
money where their mouths are, to put
political pettiness aside, let these
votes go through as they are meant to,
because these are bipartisan bills, DHS
bills that are supported broadly by
Members of this House. Let’s get on
with this, since this is an issue that we
all care about.
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this legislation,
H.R. 428, and I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from New York (Miss
RICE) that the House suspend the rules
and pass the bill, H.R. 428.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I
demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

PATHWAYS TO IMPROVING HOME-
LAND SECURITY AT THE LOCAL

I move to suspend the rules and pass
the bill (H.R. 449) to amend the Home-
land Security Act of 2002, to direct the
Assistant Secretary for State and
Local Law Enforcement to produce and
disseminate an annual catalog on De-
partment of Homeland Security train-
ing, publications, programs, and serv-
ices for State, local, and tribal law en-
forcement agencies, and for other pur-
poses.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
449, the Pathways to Improving Home-
land Security at the Local Level Act.
Mr. Speaker, I thank my Democratic
colleague, Mrs. DEMINGS, for reintro-
ducing this measure in the new Con-
gress.
Nearly 18 years ago, our country
faced the difficult realization that, in
order to effectively combat the threat
of terrorism, we needed to implement a
new whole-of-government approach. In
other words, we need all hands on deck.
Having learned from the September
11 terrorist attacks, the Department of
Homeland Security now facilitates in-
formation-sharing and collaboration
efforts between the Federal, State, and
local levels. This cooperation helps to

ensure that all government partners
are equipped with the resources and in-
formation they need to tackle the ever-
evolving threat of terrorism.
H.R. 449 will help further those ef-
forts. This bill will ensure that our Na-
tion’s first responders at the State and
local levels have easy and ready access
to DHS’ cutting-edge resources and
training programs.
H.R. 449 would require the Depart-
ment to disseminate such information
in an annual catalog. In order to maxi-
mize the catalog’s availability and
readership, this bill also calls for the
catalog to be accessible on the Depart-
ment’s website as well as on a secure
information-sharing platform.
This measure is a great example of
commonsense, bipartisan legislation
that will help build safer communities
from the ground up.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my House col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, it is part of DHS’ statu-
tory mission to support State and local
law enforcement, and the Office of
State and Local Law Enforcement has
the responsibility of proactively identi-
fying ways in which the Department
can support these important stake-
holders.
The Pathways to Improving Home-
land Security at the Local Level Act,
sponsored by the gentlewoman from
Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS), will ensure
that State and local law enforcement
receive vital information on available
DHS resources and programs.
Under the bill, the Office of State and
Local Law Enforcement will annually
produce and disseminate a catalog that
details the Department of Homeland
Security training, publications, pro-
grams, and services available to non-
Federal law enforcement agencies. The
office must disseminate the catalog
within 30 days of production to State
and local law enforcement entities.
This catalog is currently being pro-
duced by the office, and the bill re-
quires them to continue its production.
DHS also is required to share the
catalog through the Homeland Secu-
rity Information Network. Using this
existing information-sharing platform
will expand, hopefully, the number of
State and local law enforcement part-
ners who receive it.
This bill is intended to increase
awareness of DHS tools and resources
available to assist State and local law
enforcement.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this commonsense measure,
and I reserve the balance of my time.

Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS).
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman from New York for
yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I reintroduced H.R. 449
to enhance counterterrorism prepared-
ness at the local level.
In recent years, we have seen acts of
terrorism, especially in planning and
execution, take place in cities through-
out our Nation. Whether it occurs at a
church in Charleston, a synagogue in
Pittsburgh, or a nightclub in Orlando,
local law enforcement is the front line
of defense in protecting our commu-
nities from acts of violence. It is,
therefore, necessary to equip our first
responders with the tools to allow
them to quickly adapt to the evolving
terrorist threat landscape. This bill,
H.R. 449, does just that.
Today, the Department of Homeland
Security’s training catalogue is a pri-
mary resource for State and local juris-
dictions to find opportunities to en-
hance their counterterrorism and pre-
paredness capabilities.
Specifically, H.R. 449 directs DHS’
Office of State and Local Law Enforce-
ment to produce, as you have heard,
and distribute an annual catalogue of
training programs and services to
State, local, and Tribal law enforce-
ment communities. To ensure that this
information is shared throughout the
law enforcement community with
agencies large and small, H.R. 449 re-
quires this comprehensive catalogue be
posted on the DHS website, as well as
on the Homeland Security Information
Network.
Enactment of this bill will further
strengthen the Department’s partner-
ship with State and local law enforce-
ment to help better protect the home-
land. Mr. Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation.
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR).
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I am fully
in favor of this bill. Particularly, last
week, when my colleague ANDY BIGGS
and I took a bunch of our colleagues
down on the border, we were assailed
by our Border Patrol not having ade-
quate weapons and not having enough
bulletproof vests and light armor. A lot
of times, these guys are carrying
shielding that is 35 pounds. In the hot
summer, your body temperature can
rise very quickly above that.
Mr. Speaker, I support this bill. It is
a good bill. I encourage my colleagues
to vote for it.
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr.
Speaker, in closing, I thank the gentle-
woman from Florida for introducing
this important bill to ensure State and
local law enforcement are aware of the
resources DHS can provide to them.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
H.R. 449, which passed the House of
Representatives on suspension last
Congress, will strengthen the Federal
Government’s relationship with our
State and local law enforcement part-
ners.
One of our top priorities on this com-
mittee is ensuring adequate training
for our first responders and creating
collaborative partnerships between
DHS and its local counterparts. This
bill will help us accomplish that.
Mr. Speaker, I again urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 449, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from New York (Miss
RICE) that the House suspend the rules
and pass the bill, H.R. 449.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

GENERAL LEAVE
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to
include extraneous material on this
measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York?
There was no objection.
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank
my colleague on the other side of the
aisle, Mr. BACON, for reintroducing the
DHS Field Engagement Accountability
Act.
One of the core responsibilities of
this committee is to ensure collabora-
tion and information-sharing among
Federal, State, local, Tribal, and terri-
torial partners. That is how we protect
our cities from any and all terrorist
threats, whether it is one that comes
from a foreign organization or a home-
grown, lone-wolf attacker.
One example of our commitment to
this comprehensive approach is the
committee’s long history of bipartisan
support for the Department of Home-
land Security’s 79 fusion centers lo-
cated across the country. These centers
are meant to connect the dots at the
local level. They are information-shar-
ing hubs that facilitate coordination
and the sharing of resources between
Federal, State, and local law enforce-
ment officials.
However, a 2016 review found that
DHS does not have a strategic engage-
ment plan for these 79 fusion centers.
H.R. 504 will help fill that void. This
important legislation will require DHS
to develop a departmentwide strategy
for engaging and sharing information
with national fusion centers.
Additionally, this measure requires
DHS to develop metrics that will help
hold fusion center staff accountable for
their performance.
This legislation also requires DHS to
improve the classified and unclassified
information-sharing systems that are
used by fusion centers to ensure that
information is shared properly and in
accordance with Department stand-
ards. Specifically, H.R. 504 would re-
quire that all information-sharing poli-
cies are developed and maintained by
the Department’s experts on privacy,
civil rights, and civil liberties.
The recent shooting in Pittsburgh
and the spate of pipe bombs that were
mailed across the country last year are
potent reminders of how important it
is for local law enforcement agencies
to be equipped with the resources and
information they need to combat ur-
gent threats. In short, events like
these exemplify the growing need for
well-informed and well-maintained fu-
sion centers.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my House col-
leagues to support this legislation, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
504, the DHS Field Engagement Ac-
countability Act.
The Committee on Homeland Secu-
rity has long supported the role and
mission of locally owned fusion centers
across the United States. These hubs
for assessing and sharing threat infor-
mation are important links for the De-
partment of Homeland Security, the
FBI, and other Federal, State, and
local stakeholders.
The legislation before us today di-
rects the Department of Homeland Se-
curity to develop a forward-looking
strategy to improve engagement ef-
forts with fusion centers and establish
metrics for both DHS personnel and
technology deployed to fusion centers.
Clear performance metrics for fusion
center personnel are needed to ensure
fusion center directors understand
what to expect from DHS personnel de-
tailed to their centers. This effort will
also allow DHS to better track the
value fusion centers are providing to
the national information-sharing envi-
ronment.
Lastly, the bill addresses a need for
improvements to DHS information
sharing utilized by fusion centers and
other stakeholders by requiring train-
ing modules and feedback mechanisms.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative
DON BACON for his work on this legisla-
tion and his overall commitment to
Federal, State, and local information
sharing.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I have no more speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close after the gentleman
from Louisiana closes.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON), the

the gentlewoman from New York for
their leadership today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1263
January 29, 2019
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the
bill, H.R. 504, that I authored. It is
called the DHS Field Engagement Ac-
countability Act.
The purpose of this legislation is to
provide transparency, predictability,
and technology improvements to the 79
State and locally owned fusion centers
across the United States. This bill fixes
several shortfalls that were identified
by recent inspection findings.
I was able to visit the Nebraska In-
formation Analysis Center, known as
NIAC, my home State’s fusion center,
in January of this last year. The NIAC
was established in 2007 and serves as a
critical information-sharing conduit
between the State of Nebraska and the
Federal Government to the benefit of
all 93 counties in Nebraska.
While the NIAC currently has outside
support from DHS, not all fusion cen-
ters are in the same situation through-
out our country, and that needs to be
fixed. To address this shortfall, H.R.
504 requires the Department to engage
an engagement strategy for how to
best coordinate information sharing,
technology, and personnel resources
with fusion centers. Additionally, the
bill requires DHS to develop clear and
robust performance metrics for the per-
sonnel assigned to fusion centers to
provide needed accountability.
In addition to personnel, DHS also
provides fusion centers with access to
databases and information-sharing pro-
grams for classified and sensitive infor-
mation. H.R. 504 includes several provi-
sions to address improvements in
training and technology needed for
these systems, including a requirement
that DHS components share appro-
priate intelligence products with fu-
sion centers.
The sharing of counterterrorism and
other homeland security information
with State and local officials is vital in
our efforts to protect the homeland. In
the past few years, there have been sig-
nificant improvements in DHS’ support
for key stakeholders. The DHS Field
Engagement Accountability Act builds
on this progress by holding DHS more
accountable for supporting fusion cen-
ters and making the improvements
needed to truly utilize them as a re-
source for the Federal Government.
This is a commonsense bill that
passed the House last Congress. With
another strong showing of bipartisan
support from the House, I am confident
that we will be able to work with our
colleagues in the other Chamber to
enact this legislation.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this bill.
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr.
Speaker, I have no further speakers,
and I am prepared to close.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman
THOMPSON, Ranking Member ROGERS,
and Congressman BACON for bringing
this bill to the floor.
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’
on H.R. 504, to improve DHS’ coordina-
tion and information-sharing activities
with State and local fusion centers
across the country, thereby making
the homeland security intelligence en-
terprise more robust.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 504, which passed
the House on suspension last Congress,
would help ensure that fusion centers
throughout the country have access to
the resources necessary to keep our
homeland safe and secure.
By directing the Department to de-
velop a strategy for its fusion centers,
the bill seeks to enhance DHS’ overall
ability to fulfill its core mission. Addi-
tionally, H.R. 504 would ensure that
DHS’ information-sharing policies in-
clude strong privacy and civil liberty
safeguards.
Regardless of the target or the under-
lying ideology behind a terrorist plot,
State and local law enforcement enti-
ties need a clear line of communication
with their Federal counterparts.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support H.R. 504, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from New York (Miss
RICE) that the House suspend the rules
and pass the bill, H.R. 504.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on

Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,

Mr. Speaker, there is no question
that the challenges in securing our

sionmaking.

sory Board Act of 2019 does just that. It
would codify the Board into law, and
ensure that it remains an integral part
of counterterrorism policy rec-
ommendations and responses across
the Department.
Since 2010, the Counterterrorism Ad-
visory Board, or CTAB, which is com-
prised of top DHS officials, has syn-
thesized counterterrorism programs
and activities across the Department.
The CTAB helps keep America safe.
H.R. 769 would authorize the CTAB to
coordinate and integrate DHS’ intel-
ligence, policies, and activities related
to counterterrorism. H.R. 769 also di-
rects the Board to meet on a regular
basis, to coordinate and integrate the
Department’s counterterrorism efforts,
assess the current threat environment,
and establish the leadership and com-
position of the Board. H.R. 769 also re-
quires DHS to report to Congress on
the board’s status, activities, and
progress.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my House col-
leagues to support this legislation, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, in 2015, I was selected to
chair the Congressional Task Force on
Combating Terrorist and Foreign
Fighter Travel. After months of brief-
ings, site visits, and hearings, it be-
came clear that the Department of
Homeland Security had to improve in-
ternal and external coordination and
intelligence sharing to address a grow-
ing threat of foreign fighter travel, as
well as other counterterrorism efforts.
As a result, I introduced legislation
to authorize and enhance the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security Counter-
terrorism Advisory Board. Established
in 2010, the CTAB brings senior offi-
cials across the spectrum in the De-
partment to share information and co-
ordinate counterterrorism activities.
The CTAB has improved the Depart-
ment’s ability to respond to terrorism
threats and harmonize counterterror-
ism programs and activities across
DHS components.
Given that the CTAB has never been
authorized in law, the Board could be
dismantled at any time, and the coun-
terterrorism gains achieved could be
lost. The bill ensures that the CTAB
will be formally established in law. The
bill also ensures the CTAB includes ro-
bust participation from DHS-compo-
nent agencies in order to ensure all
homeland security resources are uti-
lized and the one DHS vision is real-
ized.
With ISIS having lost nearly all of
its territory and all of al-Qaida’s senior
leaders calling for unity among
jihadist groups, it is more important
than ever to ensure DHS is using all
available resources to identify and pre-
vent terrorists from coming to the
United States.
The bill requires the Department of
Homeland Security to establish a char-
ter to govern the roles and responsibil-
ities of the CTAB, and further requires
that the charter be reviewed and up-
dated at least every 4 years to ensure
the Department of Homeland Security
is keeping pace with the ever-evolving
terrorist threats.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chair-
man THOMPSON and Ranking Member
ROGERS for selecting this bill as a pri-
ority for floor consideration so early in
a new Congress. I look forward to
working with our Senate colleagues to
move this legislation through the proc-
ess, and as always, I look forward to
working with my colleague, the gentle-
woman from New York (Miss RICE).
Mr. Speaker, I am proud that this
body is working to continue to
strengthen our national security by de-
bating the legislation before us today.
I introduced this bill in the 114th
Congress and 115th Congress, and it
passed the House by an overwhelming
majority.
I urge my colleagues to again pass
this measure and support the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security’s counter-
terrorism mission, and I hope the Sen-
ate will get it through this time.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
again, H.R. 769 will authorize within
the Department of Homeland Security,
the Counterterrorism Advisory Board
to coordinate and integrate the Depart-
ment’s intelligence activities and poli-
cies as they relate to counterterrorism.
This Board already plays a central
and necessary role within DHS, and
H.R. 769 will ensure that the Counter-
terrorism Advisory Board will remain
in place for decades to come.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my col-
league and friend and fellow New York-
er, Congressman KATKO. I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 769, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from New York (Miss
RICE) that the House suspend the rules
and pass the bill, H.R. 769.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
on that I demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

EXPRESSING SENSE OF CONGRESS
THAT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
SHOULD WORK PROACTIVELY
WITH CUSTOMERS AFFECTED BY
SHUTDOWN OF FEDERAL GOV-
ERNMENT
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I move to
suspend the rules and agree to the reso-
lution (H. Res. 77) expressing the sense
of Congress that financial institutions
and other companies should work
proactively with their customers af-
fected by the shutdown of the Federal
Government who may be facing short-
term financial hardship and long-term
damage to their creditworthiness
through no fault of their own, as
amended.
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion.
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows:
H. RES. 77
Resolved, That it is the sense of Congress
that—
(1) financial institutions and other enti-
ties, such as landlords, consumer reporting
agencies and companies engaged in the pro-
duction of consumer scores, should help con-
sumers affected by any shutdown of the Fed-
eral Government, including the shutdown
that began on December 22, 2018;
(2) even with the recent conclusion of the
shutdown, the period of recovery has just
begun and the negative impact the shutdown
is having on millions of consumers and the
U.S. economy is significant; for example,
analysis from S&P Global Ratings estimates
that the U.S. economy has already lost more
than $6 billion as of January 25, 2019, and if
the shutdown were to resume in a few weeks,
the analysis suggests there would be a fur-
ther reduction of real Gross Domestic Prod-
uct by $1.2 billion each week the government
is shutdown;
(3) financial institutions and other compa-
nies, such as consumer reporting agencies
and companies engaged in the production of
consumer scores, should provide opportuni-
ties for consumers affected by any shut-
down—including Federal employees, govern-
ment contractors, small businesses, and
other individuals—who are or will be facing
financial distress to easily contact and alert
them of their situation immediately;
(4) affected consumers may face financial
hardship and emotional distress in making
timely payments on their debts, such as
mortgages, student loans, car loans, credit
cards, and other debt, as well as paying for
rent, food, transportation, school and other
basic necessities, due to the temporary delay
or permanent loss of their income;
(5) to provide quick relief to their affected
customers or tenants, financial institutions
and other entities, such as landlords, respec-
tively, should for the duration of any shut-
down, as well as for a reasonable period of
time following a shutdown, consider waiving
or reducing penalty, late payment, and simi-
lar fees; ceasing evictions and foreclosures;
and providing forbearance;
(6) consumers affected by the shutdown,
whose income are directly or indirectly de-
pendent on the full operation of the Federal
Government, may be experiencing financial
and emotional stress through no fault of

their own and their creditworthiness should
not be impaired because of the shutdown;
(7) financial institutions and other compa-
nies, such as consumer reporting agencies
and companies engaged in the production of
consumer scores, should take steps to pre-
vent adverse information being reported and
utilized in any manner that harms affected
consumers, including by preventing modified
credit arrangements intended to help con-
sumers fulfill their financial obligations
from being reported to, and coded by, con-
sumer reporting agencies on a person’s credit
report in a manner that hurts the credit-
worthiness of the affected consumers;
(8) new products, services, or prudent
workout arrangements designed to help af-
fected consumers that are consistent with
safe and sound lending practices are gen-
erally in the long-term best interest of the
financial institution, the consumer, and the
economy;
(9) financial institutions should work
proactively to identify their customers who
have been affected by any shutdown and
adopt flexible, prudent arrangements to help
such customers meet their debt and other
obligations; and
(10) prudent efforts to adopt flexible work-
out arrangements for affected consumers
should not be subject to examiner criticism
or negative examinations.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. WATERS) and the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr.
MCHENRY) each will control 20 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days within which to
revise and extend their remarks on this
legislation and to insert extraneous
material thereon.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California?
There was no objection.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge my col-
leagues to support H. Res. 77, as
amended. President Trump’s historic
35-day shutdown of the Federal Govern-
ment has had a deeply harmful impact
on millions of Americans and the U.S.
economy.
While this shutdown recently came
to an end, we must not forget the re-
covery has just begun for a wide range
of affected consumers, including Fed-
eral employees, contractors, small
businesses, and other individuals.
Many of those people will not receive
back pay. Many of them have various
financial obligations, like a mortgage,
or a student loan payment that they
may have missed. However, they did
not cause the shutdown and should not
suffer any negative consequences from
it.
Financial institutions and other enti-
ties, like landlords and consumer re-
porting agencies, can play a key role in
helping these innocent people. Given
the financial hardship and emotional
distress these consumers face, through
no fault of their own, I introduced H.
Res. 77 to send a strong message to the
financial industry that they should do
what they can to help these innocent
consumers.
Specifically, the resolution expresses
the sense of Congress that financial in-
stitutions and other entities should
work proactively to help all consumers
affected by the shutdown. This includes
waiving fees, ceasing evictions and
foreclosures, and otherwise providing
forbearance for any affected consumer,
as well as taking steps to ensure their
creditworthiness is not impaired be-
cause of the shutdown.
Financial regulators agree that it is
appropriate for financial institutions
to offer prudent accommodations to
help their affected customers. On Janu-
ary 10, I wrote to the regulators to en-
courage them to provide public guid-
ance to financial institutions to under-
score they could affirmatively make
prudent workout arrangements con-
sistent with safety and soundness with-
out fear of being subject to examiner
criticisms. I am glad that they made
such a statement the very next day.
On January 18, I wrote a letter to
various financial services trade organi-
zations, as well as the three largest
credit reporting agencies, to encourage
their institutions and member compa-
nies to take all prudent and appro-
priate actions, including those outlined
in the regulators interagency state-
ment, to help any consumer who may
be affected by the shutdown.
While I appreciate that many finan-
cial institutions have already an-
nounced various accommodations for
affected consumers, I believe it is im-
portant that there be a robust effort by
all financial institutions, consumer re-
porting agencies, and others to do what
they can to help in the weeks and
months to come which H. Res. 77 seeks
to encourage.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support H. Res. 77, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recogni-
tion of the 800,000 Federal employees
impacted by the partial government
shutdown and express my sincere
agreement that banks and Federal reg-
ulators should do the compassionate
and the sensible thing, to support cus-
tomers in need of assistance.
Mr. Speaker, whether it was a missed
credit card payment or an unexpected
medical expense, many furloughed Fed-
eral employees have faced economic
hardships over the last 35 days,
through no fault of their own. A string
of dead-end and dead-on-arrival bills
and nonstarter negotiations thrust
hardworking Federal employees into
the middle of a political fight, all over
commonsense border security measures
that I support, and that many Demo-
crats have supported previously.
Our only course of action at that
time and now is to try and provide
some relief to those who are in need,
and most importantly, find a solution
to ensure that the government doesn’t
shut down again on February 15. But
those are larger political issues, and we
are trying to be of substance as to what
we can do to be of assistance to those
who were affected by the government
shutdown within our committee of ju-
risdiction, the Financial Services Com-
mittee.
I appreciate Chairwoman WATERS’ ef-
forts to provide support for hard-
working Federal employees by intro-
ducing this resolution and encouraging
banks to assist their customers in
need.
Thankfully, many financial institu-
tions are already doing exactly what is
suggested in this resolution, and that,
as Chairwoman WATERS said in her
statement, is at the urging of Members
of Congress, but also their under-
standing of the needs in their commu-
nities, like waiving late fees for fur-
loughed employees, or the other over
100 banks that took it upon themselves
for loan modifications and payment
deadline extension, payroll advances,
low-rate and zero-rate loans, as well as
other accommodations, and those are
wonderful things, positive things.
Unfortunately, we now find ourselves
in a situation where the financial regu-
latory regime has left banks trying
their best under a cloud of uncertainty
on how regulators will react to their
efforts during the government shut-
down.
While I agree with my colleague
across the aisle that we should encour-
age banks to work more proactively
with customers affected in the shut-
down, we must also encourage our fi-
nancial regulators to provide clarity to
our financial institutions that they are
permitted to provide that type of re-
lief.
I have no doubt this issue will be a
part of a larger conversation I hope
that we can have on the Financial
Services Committee about what regu-
lators are doing to help individual tax-
payers and also what they are doing
that hurts the American people as well.
Mr. Speaker, I think this is a good
bill that I encourage my colleagues to
support.
Mr. HARRIS. Will the gentleman
yield for a question?
Mr. MCHENRY. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland.
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, my read-
ing of the bill is not furloughed em-
ployees. It is anyone affected. It has a
very broad definition. Without putting
any guardrails on it, one could argue
that every American was probably af-
fected in some way. Is that true? Is my
reading of the bill that this extends
way beyond furloughed employees? It
affects any consumer affected. Is that
correct?
Mr. MCHENRY. Reclaiming my time,
I did not write the legislation. The in-
tention here is the encouragement of
Federal regulators to take a new look.
I think that is the broad understanding
of what this resolution gets to. I re-
serve the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1266 January 29, 2019
b 1400
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentlewoman from New
York (Ms. VELÁZQUEZ), who is a senior
member of the Financial Services Com-
mittee and chairwoman of the Small
Business Committee.
Ms. VELÁZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the chairwoman, MAXINE
WATERS, and the ranking member, Mr.
MCHENRY, for this important resolu-
tion.
Last week, Democrats stood united
and ended the longest government
shutdown in history. We should be
clear: This shutdown was caused solely
by President Trump’s personal obses-
sion with the border wall.
Roughly 800,000 Federal workers were
either furloughed or forced to work
without pay. More than 1 million con-
tractors were forced to miss multiple
paychecks.
Now, Donald Trump may not relate
to this, but for these workers, this
means bills piling up. It means choos-
ing between putting gasoline in your
car or groceries in your refrigerator.
Throughout the shutdown, my office
was in contact with several financial
institutions and companies that were
offering forbearance options, waiving
late fees, and providing short-term, no-
interest loans for affected workers.
That is admirable, and I thank them.
However, the media also reported on
numerous workers who were forced to
take out personal loans and cash ad-
vances on credit cards, or who even
turned to predatory payday loans to
make ends meet.
For example, NBC News recently re-
ported on one company offering per-
sonal installment loans that had seen
an uptick in customers looking to use
their products. It is perhaps no coinci-
dence that this uptick coincided with a
nearly 19 percent rise in the company’s
stock since the shutdown began.
This is unconscionable. Financial in-
stitutions and companies should not be
preying on Federal employees or con-
tractors who went nearly a month
without pay. Instead, they should be
working with those affected to get
them back on track and rebuild their
lives.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair WATERS
for offering this important resolution
to further that goal, and I urge all my
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from West
Virginia (Mr. MOONEY).
Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Actu-
ally, Mr. Speaker, I have a point of
clarification for the chairman.
Is this bill affecting all furloughed
Federal workers, anyone furloughed, or
anyone affected by the furlough in any
way? Any consumer, any American
that is affected?
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, this reso-
lution is intended not only to help Fed-
eral employees as such, but contrac-
tors, small businesses, and others that
are connected to government in ways
that you may not be able to absolutely
identify here. You may have folks who
are consultants who are not considered
contractors. You may have others who
will be affected by this who maybe had
a contract with the Federal Govern-
ment that is now in litigation that has
to be dealt with.
That is what we are intending to do,
not just have a blanket, blanket, blan-
ket, but some connection to the Fed-
eral Government.
Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr.
Speaker, in West Virginia’s Second
District, we have a lot of Federal work-
ers and contractors who are affected.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield
an additional 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from West Virginia.
Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr.
Speaker, I thank the chairman for
clarifying that.
Of course, there are a lot of folks in
my district who are affected by the
shutdown and also affected indirectly
because they are contractors and such.
I have had them approach me over the
last few weeks, wondering if their
backlogged projects were going to get
funded. It is important to clarify that.
Of course, we should backpay people,
and the good, hardworking Americans
who make this country go around need
to get paid.
I understand a little bit of an obses-
sion on the other side against a border
wall that was mentioned by the pre-
vious speaker, when this is really
about how government should function
and appropriate funds in the appro-
priate way, and the power of the purse.
Frankly, getting bills through the
House and the Senate has become quite
a problem, particularly with the other
Chamber, which doesn’t seem to pass
anything and then wants us to do just
whatever the Senate does.
We have a lot of dysfunction, particu-
larly on the other side, and that is
what has cost the workers, not this
wall. The wall is something the Presi-
dent said he would do. It is not the
wall; it is the dysfunction of passing
bills around here that has caused these
problems.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the leader for
the extra minute.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, let me
say this: I know that we all want to
help all of those who have been af-
fected by the shutdown, and so I hope I
was able to clarify that, so that people
can help the constituents in their dis-
tricts even in ways they may not have
understood.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from Florida (Mr.
LAWSON).
Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in support of H. Res. 77. This
resolution expresses the sense that fi-
nancial institutions should do every-
thing within their power to ensure that
their customers who were impacted by
the Trump shutdown receive the re-
sources they need to get back on track.
Nearly 800,000 Federal workers across
this Nation were impacted by the shut-
down, 13,000 of which are in my dis-
trict. Throughout my district in Flor-
ida, from Quincy, Tallahassee, Jack-
sonville, and even in the rural areas,
constituents expressed to me the chal-
lenges of not receiving their pay-
checks. This meant not paying their
mortgage or rent, not paying for
childcare, hardships purchasing gas
and groceries, or having to miss a car
note. Some of these individuals even
relied on their banks for loans.
These are hardworking Americans
who did not ask for the shutdown,
should not have had to suffer as a pawn
in the shutdown, or did not deserve to
be furloughed because of a shutdown.
That is unacceptable.
Because of the shutdown, these em-
ployees made difficult financial deci-
sions. That is why it is necessary for
our financial institutions to step up
and provide relief to those impacted.
That means extending payment dead-
lines, reducing the interest rate on
short-term loans, and providing finan-
cial and customer education that will
help Federal employees prepare for the
potential of other financial hardships.
Mr. Speaker, I applaud Congress-
woman WATERS for introducing this
resolution and for standing up for Fed-
eral workers, and I ask that all of my
colleagues in this House vote in favor.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time to close.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this House resolution. I think
this resolution truly expresses the
sense of Congress that we should pro-
vide relief that, voluntarily, over 100 fi-
nancial institutions have already com-
mitted to do publicly over the course of
the shutdown. But I think it shows
that we are a compassionate group of
folks here in the House of Representa-
tives and that we want to be sensible in
every way possible, even in the midst
of these major political fights that do
occur from time to time, perhaps, here
on this House floor.
Those disagreements notwith-
standing, what we want to do is work
in a proactive way and in a bipartisan
way to convey to the public that there
are sensible things that we are about,
and that Republicans and Democrats
still can get things done here on the
House floor, here doing the people’s
business and the people’s work.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support Chairwoman WATERS’ resolu-
tion here today, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time to close.
Mr. Speaker, this shutdown has in-
flicted tremendous harm on consumers
and the U.S. economy. The Congres-
sional Budget Office estimated the ini-
tial cost for the recent shutdown is
more than $11 billion and wrote:

largest and most direct negative ef-
fects are Federal workers who faced de-
layed compensation and private-sector
entities that lost business. Some of
those private-sector entities will never
recoup that lost income. . . . And peo-
ple who lost income and consequently
borrowed money during the shutdown
will see an increase in expenses as they
pay interest on that debt.’’
I hope my colleagues on both sides of
the aisle would agree that it would be
unfair if these innocent consumers
were to suffer any negative con-
sequences from the shutdown and that
financial institutions and others
should do what they can to help.
Mr. Speaker, I just want to try and
give some comfort to those who think
that maybe there are individuals who
are not federally connected who would
be getting help with this kind of ap-
proach, but that is absolutely not true.
I could not list every possible way, but
I am reminded that my husband was an
Ambassador to the Commonwealth of
the Bahamas. I am reminded of the
families who were there. I am reminded
of the children whose education we
paid for while they were in that coun-
try, and the education of other families
of ambassadors and diplomats for
whom the Federal Government pays.
We would not want to not reimburse
for the education of our children in for-
eign countries, et cetera. So there are
many ways that people who are con-
nected to the Federal Government are
impacted by this.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to say to
Mr. MCHENRY: Thank you so very much
for your support.
Again, this is a fine example of how
both sides of the aisle can agree on a
commonsense resolution that will help
all those who have been impacted by
this shutdown.
I am very pleased to have the support
of Mr. MCHENRY. We have been trying
desperately in the work that we do, as
we began this session of Congress, to
show that you can work cooperatively
with both sides of the aisle working to-
gether on a bill, resolution, legislation,
et cetera, that really does support and
help our families and all the people in
the country who are looking to us for
support and leadership.
Again, I thank Mr. MCHENRY, and I
thank all the Members on the opposite
side of the aisle who get this and who
understand it and whose contractors
and others are on them saying: What
are you going to do? What are you
going to do?
This is our effort, and I appreciate
their support.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance

Ms. JACKSON LEE changed her vote
from ‘‘nay’’ to ‘‘yea.’’
So the motion to table was agreed to.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
The title of the resolution was
amended so as to read: ‘‘Resolution ex-
pressing the sense of Congress that fi-
nancial institutions and other entities
should work proactively with their cus-
tomers affected by the shutdown of the
Federal Government who may be fac-
ing short-term financial hardship and
long-term damage to their credit-
worthiness through no fault of their
own.’’.
Stated for:
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I missed
the vote due to a press conference for my first
bill in Rayburn. Had I been present, I would
have voted ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 59 on the mo-
tion to table.
Stated against:
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I was
unavoidably detained. Had I been present, I
would have voted ‘‘nay’’ on rollcall No. 59.

HONORING JOEL SCHRIER
(Ms. SCHRIER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker,
today is different because today I
would like to honor my father, Joel
Schrier, who celebrates his 80th birth-
day this weekend.
He grew up in the Bronx in a one-bed-
room apartment with his parents and
his three siblings, including his twin
sister, Gloria, who will also celebrate
this weekend.
He went on to study physics and
work as an aerospace engineer, marry
my mom, Joan, in 1964, and be a phe-
nomenal father to my brother, Marc,
and me. He was engaged and involved
in our upbringing at a time when most
fathers weren’t. He taught me to bike
and skate, showed me how to make the
best French toast from Friday night
challah, and inspired me to study phys-
ics. When I was diagnosed with diabe-
tes, he helped me with shots and check-
ing my blood sugar levels. Weekends
were always for family. And for that,
mom, Marc, and I are deeply grateful.
Of course, it is the values that he and
mom instilled in me that really led me
to run for Congress. A strong sense of
justice and fairness, and an ethic that
if something is wrong in the world, you
do something about it: to be an
upstander and not a bystander.
So, Dad, thank you, and happy birth-
day. We love you.
f
CONGRATULATING MAYOR KEVIN
HARTKE
(Mr. BIGGS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Chandler Mayor
Kevin Hartke, who took his oath of of-
fice earlier this month. Mayor Hartke
previously served on the Chandler City
Council, where he was, most recently,
the vice mayor.
Mayor Hartke and his family are
longtime Chandler residents, and they
are extremely active in their commu-
nity. He and his wife, Lynne, have been
married for 37 years, and have four
children and four grandchildren. He
served on one of my advisory councils
in the last Congress, offering a distinct
perspective on how my staff and I could
engage the faith-based community.
Madam Speaker, individuals like
Mayor Hartke provide stability and
vital leadership to our cities and
towns. Chandler was recently rated as
the number ten city in the country for
job seekers. Under Mayor Hartke’s di-
rection, I have every confidence that
he will continue to help Chandler’s

LET’S GET DOPING OUT OF THE
OLYMPICS
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
as we put the pieces back together
again, the Budget Committee had a
meeting with the Congressional Budget
Office director. We know that it is
clear that during this shutdown, the
Nation lost $11 billion; $3 billion of it
will not be recoverable. A shutdown is
foolish. It hurts the American people.
And I am committed: One, to in-
crease the pay of American workers,
Federal workers, tomorrow, and, as
well, to reflect that a shutdown should
not hold our patriotic fellow workers
hostage.
I ask my colleagues to join me in
that.
Today, however, I am excited that I
am introducing a bill, which is H.R.
835, the Anti-Doping Act, with Dr. BUR-
GESS and, of course, in the other body,
Senator WICKER and Senator WHITE-
HOUSE, that deals with the World Anti-
Doping Agency that failed to suspend
the Russian Anti-Doping Agency for
missing a crucial December 31, 2018,
deadline, and for the violations at the
Olympics.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues
to join in supporting this legislation.
Let’s get doping out of the Olympics.
Let’s have sports that are fair and
square and to do what is right for these
wonderful young athletes.
f
MAJD KAMALMAZ—CAPTIVE IN
SYRIA
(Mr. HILL of Arkansas asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam
Speaker, today, I rise to bring atten-
tion to Majd Kamalmaz, an American
being held by Syria’s dictator, Bashar
al-Assad.
In February 2017, Majd was detained
by Syrian police while visiting the
country for the funeral of his father-in-
law.
When I spoke to Majd’s children, last
week, they told me they had tried to
convince him not to go to Syria, but
their father always put others ahead of
himself.
Majd’s personal motto is ‘‘be in
peace,’’ and that motto has been on
display throughout his life, in his work
around the world, in places like
Kosovo, Indonesia, Lebanon, and here
at home after Katrina.
Majd’s children have not seen or
heard from their father for nearly 2
years. Madam Speaker, I echo their
plea and call on President Trump to do
what he can to ensure that their father
is safely returned to his homeland in
America.
f
RECOGNIZING 158TH BIRTHDAY OF
KANSAS
(Mr. MARSHALL asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to recognize my home
State’s 158th birthday.
As we traveled thousands of miles
throughout Kansas this past week and
enjoyed some time pheasant hunting
countryside with my family, I spent a
lot of time reflecting on the great
things that the Wheat State has to
offer.
Kansas is known for its abundance of
farmland that is used to grow crops far
and wide producing the food we eat
across the Nation and across the world.
It is home to the most stunning sun-
sets you could ever witness and the
beautiful Flint Hills that stretch over
150 miles where I grew up working,
hunting, and fishing.
But my absolute favorite part about
the State I call home are the people.
Where I am from, we always put our
faith in family first; we support each
other, uplift each other, and are resil-
ient through tough times. I am hon-
ored to represent so many wonderful
people and proud to be a Kansan.

ACHIEVING THE AMERICAN
DREAM
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to tell you how honored I am to
have been recently selected to serve as
the senior Republican on the Early
Childhood, Elementary and Secondary
Education Subcommittee under the
House Education and Labor Committee
for the 116th Congress.
As the son of two educators and
grandfather of 13, many of whom are
currently in school, I couldn’t be
happier to serve as the leading Repub-
lican on the subcommittee that ad-
dresses a variety of issues affecting K–
12 education.
I have visited numerous schools
throughout the 12th Congressional Dis-
trict, and during every visit, I stress to
young scholars how important for their
future it is to get an education.
With nearly 7 million available jobs
throughout our country, it is critical
that we cultivate a qualified workforce
to fill all of these positions, and this
mission starts in the classroom.
As the leading Republican, I look for-
ward to working with my colleagues to
ensure that K–12 education remains
local, while also providing appropriate
Federal support so that our Nation’s
students can sufficiently be prepared to
enter the workforce and everyone can
achieve the American Dream.
HONORING THE LIFE OF DONALD
LOUIS CRUTCH
(Mr. YOHO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, today I
rise to honor the memory of a great
man who had a profound impact on our
local community. Mr. Donald Louis
Crutch was a father, husband, Rotar-
ian, and dedicated member of the com-
munity.
His wife, Lisa, was his high school
sweetheart and together they raised
four great children: Tiara, Dontai,
Taniyah, and DaVontai, and he leaves
behind a large and loving family of
cousins, nephews, nieces, uncles, aunts,
and friends. His contributions will be
forever remembered.
He was the founder of two nonprofit
organizations: the National Pink Tie
Organization, and the Honor Guards of
America. You could always find Don
wearing a hot pink shirt in support of
those battling cancer, and he would
never accept less than six lemons in his
ice tea.
It was these little things like his
megawatt smile and warm handshake
that made him a pillar of our commu-
nity.
While we miss Don greatly, his leg-
acy will live on.
f
REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF
HOWARD MORRISON
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to remember the
life of my good friend and the friend of
many Savannahans, Mr. Howard Morri-
son, who passed away on January 24.
Mr. Morrison, with his exceptional
talent for bringing people together pro-
pelled Savannah to make great strides
throughout the community. A Yale
graduate, Mr. Morrison served in the
Navy before embarking on a 30-year
banking career in the Savannah bank-
ing industry.
He always held firm that the most
important contributions to Savannah
were education, healthcare, and com-
munity development. To that end, he
worked hard to bring a Georgia Tech
campus to the Savannah area. Georgia
Tech Savannah recently presented him
with the Opportunity Award, given to
those who have created opportunities
for others.
One of Mr. Morrison’s closest friends
remembers him coaxing numerous indi-
viduals to move to Savannah because
of the opportunities, many of which he
was creating himself.
Madam Speaker, I am proud that Sa-
vannah had someone like Howard Mor-
rison, who helped it become the city it
is today. His family and his many
friends will be in my thoughts and
prayers.

NEGOTIATE BORDER SECURITY
(Mr. LEVIN of Michigan asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam
Speaker, while the longest government
shutdown in our country’s history fi-
nally ended over the weekend, its ef-
fects continue to plague working fami-
lies.
For 35 days the President held hos-
tage the paychecks, financial security,
and health and wellbeing of hundreds
of thousands of Federal workers, in-
cluding 5,200 from Michigan.
The President’s stunt did nothing to
advance real border security discus-
sions and resulted in a colossal waste
of time and resources. He cost the
American economy $11 billion; iron-
ically, nearly twice as much as he
wanted for an ineffective border wall.
As the President threatens another
shutdown, I rise today to demand that
he never again use this cruel tactic,
and to, instead, come to the table, the
negotiating table in good faith.
Democrats support effective border
security solutions, and we are here to
talk so long as working families are
not used as pawns in the political proc-
ess.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
f
FIRE SAFETY REMAINS A DIRE
ISSUE
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to remind people, that al-
though it is wintertime, a rainy sea-
son, a stormy season, that we are still
in a dire circumstance on fire safety in
our forested areas, California, of the
West, and many areas of the United
States.
So for us to just be comfortable dur-
ing the wintertime, during the rainy
season and not think about it would be
in error. We need to do much to catch
up on the forest inventory we have
across this country, across the West.
That will require USDA, the U.S.
Forest Service, our States, our local
governments, Tribes, and everybody to
be able to coordinate much better than
we have in the past to reduce this fuel
load, this inventory we have in our for-
ests that makes it so dangerous when
fire season comes around once again.
We have seen that with so many dev-
astating fires in the West, just this
year in my own district, the Carr fire
in the Redding area, and the Camp fire
in the Paradise area.
Many factors go into what causes
these fires, but we can at least be
proactive in thinning our Federal for-
ests, thinning the material that needs
to come out of there, putting people
back to work doing that, using this
material for biomass, generating elec-
tricity, and the wood and paper prod-
ucts that we all need and enjoy.
We need to move fast-forward on the
pace and scale of what it takes to make
our forested areas fire safe, healthy,
good for the economy, and good for all
of us.

THE PEOPLE’S NIGHT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from North
Carolina (Mr. WALKER) is recognized
for 60 minutes as the designee of the
minority leader.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. WALKER. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and introduce ex-
traneous material into the RECORD on
the topic of this Special Order.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from North Carolina?
There was no objection.
Mr. WALKER. Madam Speaker, to-
night is a reminder of exactly whose
House this belongs to. We hear much in
the political circles as far as who
makes the call and who gets to speak
when. Today, customarily, is a very
unique and special day had our Presi-
dent not been disinvited.
Well, tonight we will have a few
Members speaking on the importance
of hearing from the Members that
Americans have elected to talk about
the issues of the past 2 years, and some
of the things that we need to accom-
plish over the next couple of years.
We have some wonderful speakers
this afternoon and this evening, to be
able to share some of the topics that
are important to our constituents as
well as to all Americans.
The first speaker I would like to in-
troduce to you is Mr. MIKE JOHNSON,
who represents the Fourth District of
Louisiana, and is currently leading the
largest caucus in all of Congress as
chairman of the Republican Study
Committee.
Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to
the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.
JOHNSON).
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam
Speaker, I thank my friend from the
great State of North Carolina for invit-
ing me to speak on this topic.
I stand before you in disbelief and in
sorrow tonight. It has been mentioned
that the State of the Union Address
was originally scheduled to take place
today, and it has been rescheduled for
next week.
I think it is appropriate for us then
to bring attention to what is happening
here in the people’s House. I think the
American people deserve to know that.
As we speak, I think the American peo-
ple need to know that partisan tactics
are underway by certain House Demo-
crats to undermine American values
and traditions that have been cher-
ished and practiced here since the time
of our founding.
As we finally begin our committee
work in the 116th Congress, I am proud
to serve again on the Judiciary Com-
mittee and the House Natural Re-
sources Committee. We have just begun
the process of adopting our committee
rules there, and today, we were issued
a list of proposed rule changes that the
Democrat majority and the Natural
Resources Committee will apparently
push through at our hearing tomorrow.
Among the radical new changes to
the rules is a stunning action to re-
move the phrase, ‘‘So help me God’’
from the oath taken by witnesses be-
fore they testify to Congress. Did you
hear that? Let me repeat it. Among the
radical new changes in our committee
is a stunning action to remove the
phrase ‘‘So help me God’’ from the oath
taken by witnesses before they testify
to Congress.

surge to the far left that we are seeing

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1273
January 29, 2019
has to be stopped. This new agenda is
threatening the very fabric of our Na-
tion. Throughout America’s history,
our Presidents and elected officials
have taken a solemn oath of office in-
cluding the words, ‘‘So help me God.’’
This goes back to our founding. Since
the Judiciary Act of 1789, every justice
of the U.S. Supreme Court and all
lower-court judges have taken an oath
of office which concludes with the
same phrase and, of course, every court
of law across this land, in every one of
them, all witnesses have always been
sworn in for testimony with those
same concluding words.
For more than two centuries, immi-
grants from all around the world have
come here and taken America’s oath of
allegiance to become naturalized citi-
zens which also concludes with the
phrase, ‘‘So help me God.’’
Madam Speaker, some of our Demo-
crat colleagues need to be reminded of
our history. Why did the Founders in-
stitute this practice? Well, let’s re-
member what they said. Our first
President, George Washington, was the
Father of our country. And in his fa-
mous farewell address, he gave his ad-
vice that echoes down through the gen-
erations to you and to me as the elect-
ed Representatives of the people. He
said, famously: ‘‘Of all the dispositions
and habits which lead to political pros-
perity, religion and morality are indis-
pensable supports.’’
John Adams was our second Presi-
dent. He came next. What did he say?
He said: ‘‘Our Constitution is made
only for a moral and religious people.
It is wholly inadequate to the govern-
ment of any other.’’
In other words, what these two
Founders and their fellow patriots all
understood from our history, was that
there are many important rules and
practices that can help sustain and
build a healthy republic, but the key
they said, the essential foundation of a
republic has to be a common commit-
ment among the citizenry to the prin-
ciples of religion and morality and ac-
countability to God himself.
The Founders acknowledged this self-
evident truth that all men are created
equal and that God gives all men the
same inalienable rights. However, they
knew, that in order to maintain a gov-
ernment ‘‘of the people, by the people,
for the people,’’ as Lincoln later said,
those inalienable rights must be exer-
cised in a responsible manner.
They, thus, believed in liberty that is
legitimately constrained by a common
sense of morality, and a healthy fear of
the God who granted all men our
rights.
The Founders understood that all
men are fallen and that power cor-
rupts. They also knew that no amount
of institutional checks and balances or
decentralization of power and civil au-
thorities would be sufficient to main-
tain a just government if the men in
charge had no fear of eternal judgment
by a power higher than their temporal
institutions.
That is just a quick review of our his-
tory, but that is the reason we con-
clude our oaths in this country with
the phrase ‘‘So help me God.’’ Heaven
help us if we ever forget that obliga-
tion.
Inscribed on the third panel of the
Jefferson Memorial right here in Wash-
ington, D.C., just a few blocks from
here, is his sobering reminder to every
single one of us as American citizens.
He said this, it is right there on the
wall: ‘‘God who gave us life gave us lib-
erty. Can the liberties of a nation be
secure when we have removed a convic-
tion that these liberties are the gift of
God? Indeed, I tremble for my country
when I reflect that God is just, that his
justice cannot sleep forever.’’
Madam Speaker, I just want you to
know and I want the American people
to know back home here on the night
that should have been the State of the
Union Address, as we talk about the
State of our union, I want you to know
that we are going to fight this radical
rules change tomorrow in our com-
mittee because it matters. And we will
continue to raise the alarm about the
dangerous leftist agenda that is taking
hold here in this Congress.
While I am at it, I would be remiss if
I did not note, Madam Speaker, that
this is not the end. The radical agenda
is advancing in State legislatures now
as well.
Last week, New York’s Governor
signed the infamous Reproductive
Health Act, the RHA, into law. This
bill’s extreme provisions eliminate pro-
tections for the unborn, endangering
the health of mothers, and eliminate
New York’s few remaining safeguards
for developing human life.
b 1545
As enacted, the RHA establishes the
fundamental right to abortion. It per-
mits nonphysicians to perform abor-
tions; it repeals State protections for
children born during an abortion; and
it eliminates all fetal homicide provi-
sions. The bill’s broad health exception
allows for an abortion at, literally, any
point in their pregnancy.
Look, this measure is unconscion-
able. It is disturbing. And we expect
our friends and all people of good con-
science—even on the other side of the
aisle—to condemn this outrageous at-
tack on the vulnerable.
Madam Speaker, we are forgetting
our history. We have to remember why
we as Americans believe in the sanc-
tity of human life.
I will conclude with this, by just re-
minding us, again, that our Founders
openly acknowledged, they broadly
proclaimed what has been called the
American Creed. It is listed in the sec-
ond paragraph of the Declaration that
‘‘we hold these truths to be self-evi-
dent, that all men are created equal,’’
and that God is the one that gives us
our rights, and our rights are
unalienable. The first listed is the
right to life.
Have we thought about why the
Founders said that? Because they un-
derstood that every single person is
made in the image of God. And because
every person is made in the image of
God, every single person has ines-
timable dignity and value. Your value
is not related in any way to where you
grew up or the color of your skin or
how intelligent you may be, what your
talents are, what you make for a liv-
ing. Those are irrelevant. Your value is
inherent because it is given to you by
your creator.
Madam Speaker, I conclude with
this: As we reflect upon the State of
the Union, the state of the Union is
strong in so many ways, but we have
our challenges. Among the challenges
is an assault, an aggressive agenda to
remove and erase these critical and im-
portant foundations.
So here on the People’s Night, here
in the people’s House, we want to re-
mind the people of what is happening
on our watch. We will stand against
these things. We will continue to de-
fend what is best about our American
traditions, and we are honored to have
that opportunity.
Mr. WALKER. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for his wonderful
words of wisdom and inspiration.
A lot of times in the House, we hear
politicians say, even throughout our
State, that we are doing things for the
people. And I guess, to some degree,
some of that is okay. But for us to be
successful, I think we have to get back
to the place that we are doing things
with the people. No one embodies that
more in the House than past chairman
and ranking member of Ways and
Means, Mr. KEVIN BRADY.
In taking a moment of personal privi-
lege here, I get a chance to meet lots of
figures: lots of politicians, lots of
Presidents, kings, and queens through-
out this country—and throughout this
world, actually—but few people I have
ever met who carried the servant spirit
and the servant heart more than our
top Republican on Ways and Means.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY), proud-
ly representing Texas’ Eighth District.
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I rise
this afternoon, first, to thank the gen-
tleman, my friend from the Sixth Dis-
trict of North Carolina, Congressman
MARK WALKER, for his leadership in our
Republican House Conference, for his
leadership in helping improve the lives
of not just North Carolinians, but
every American, and, tonight, for orga-
nizing today’s Special Order, ‘‘The Peo-
ple’s Night,’’ #witthepeople, on a night
we had hoped our President would be
here, as tradition requires, to give the
State of the Union.
I want to thank those who are here
tonight. We heard from Mr. JOHNSON
and my colleagues who are speaking
tonight on the issues that are so im-
portant to the American people.
Whether it is jobs, better wages, a
stronger economy, more affordable and
accessible healthcare, supporting re-
sources for our troops and veterans, se-
curing our border, standing with Israel,

H1274 January 29, 2019
or, as Mr. JOHNSON pointed out, pro-
tecting the lives of the innocent un-
born, I am proud to join you in this
fight.
Let’s talk about the economy and
jobs. We have seen such dramatic dif-
ference the last 2 years. Remember, be-
fore that, the economy had struggled
for more than a decade. Every expert in
Washington was telling the American
people: Just get used to that. Get used
to your paychecks being flat. Get used
to jobs moving overseas. Get used to
your kids coming out of school with
fair to low opportunities. That is the
new normal.
Well, Republicans and President
Trump believed there was a better fu-
ture, a brighter future for America, so
we went to work. As a result, because
of our commitment to lifting red tape
off of our local small businesses and de-
livering the first overhaul of our Tax
Code in more than 30 years, America is
back, and the American people are
doing better because of it: wages are
rising the fastest in a decade; Amer-
ica’s economy is growing the fastest in
more than a decade; and unemploy-
ment is at one of the lowest levels in
decades.
We did this by working with Presi-
dent Trump to lift more than $33 bil-
lion in red tape off our local businesses
so they can hire again, so they can
grow again.
Then we tackled this terrible Tax
Code that had been placed, and put in
place one that lowers taxes for all
Americans, that helps small businesses
grow and invest, that doubles the child
tax credit, that doubles the standard
deductions and changes the dynamics
so that jobs investment comes back to
America rather than just being strand-
ed overseas. And, boy, what a dif-
ference it is making.
Due to the Republican pro-growth
policies and President Trump’s tax
cuts, our economy exceeded 3 percent
growth over the past year. That never
happened under our previous President.
So much for that new normal of slow
growth.
More than 5 million jobs have been
created since President Trump was
elected, including more than 2.5 mil-
lion since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
was signed into law. Last week, our un-
employment jobless claims were at a
50-year low. That is a 50-year best for
that.
The unemployment rate for African
Americans fell to the lowest rate ever
on record. For Asian and Hispanic
Americans, their unemployment rates
are the best we have seen in decades.
For those who are disabled, for those
coming out of prison, for those without
high school educations, for those who
are teenagers, the job opportunities are
the best they have seen in decades. The
unemployment rate, in some cases, is
the best since we have started record-
ing it.
And the group I watched the most,
sort of the underdogs in every commu-
nity, are those who didn’t even get a
chance to finish high school or get a
GED, that are always the first to be
laid off, always the last to be rehired.
Well, under this new economy, the un-
employment for those without a high
school degree is the best since America
started recording it.
So our brothers and sisters in our
communities and neighborhoods have
more job opportunities than they have
seen in a long time, and their pay-
checks are going up as well, the fastest
in more than a decade.
It had been stuck flat for so many
Americans for so long, it just was hard
for families to make ends meet. But
now, with higher paychecks and a tax
cut for over 90 percent of American
workers, families now have a budget
that goes a little farther each week,
where they can invest in themselves
and their American Dream rather than
in Washington’s dream.
Consumer confidence has soared.
American manufacturing is back. In
fact, the National Association of Manu-
facturers, their index has the highest
annual growth in jobs in history, over
the past year. In fact, last year, manu-
facturing in America added almost
290,000 new jobs.
Finally, small business optimism is
through the roof. They are investing
and hiring and growing again on Main
Streets all across America.
This didn’t happen by accident. Re-
publicans working closely with Presi-
dent Trump decided there was a bright-
er future for America. We could get out
of the doldrums. We could give people
opportunities. We could boost their
paycheck, and we could bring jobs back
from overseas. That is the difference
the last 2 years has made for America.
And when the State of the Union is
held, President Trump, from the dais
behind me, can talk about the huge dif-
ference he has made in the American
economy and what it means for work-
ing families and small businesses along
Main Street.
Madam Speaker, I again thank the
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.
WALKER) for his leadership and for or-
ganizing the People’s Night, and I am
proud to be part of it.
Mr. WALKER. Madam Speaker, I
thank the ranking Republican on our
Ways and Means Committee, KEVIN
BRADY, for the wonderful service that
he continues to display not just to the
good people of the Lone Star State, but
to all Americans.
We had a lot of retirements this past
election, but not all the adults left the
building. We have a wonderful veteran
and former Korean veteran—actually,
OB/GYN doctor, who delivered nearly
5,000 babies—the ranking member, past
chairman of the Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee. I ask PHIL ROE from Tennessee
to share a few things on his heart; be-
cause there are few people who have
had his experience level, and I believe
it would behoove us all to listen to the
words of wisdom from Mr. PHIL ROE.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P.
ROE).
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr.
WALKER) for the work he has done as
our past chairman of the Republican
Study Committee and now in leader-
ship and our Conference, and I appre-
ciate the opportunity to be here to-
night.
I remember, about 2 years ago, I was
up late at night watching the election
returns, and then-President-elect
Trump announced his acceptance
speech. He was not 3 minutes into his
speech when he said that he wanted to
help our Nation’s veterans.
It was very near and dear to my
heart because I am a generation of vet-
erans. That was during the Vietnam
war, and we were not so much appre-
ciated and treated rather shabbily by
our country.
So I knew what was in President
Trump’s heart, and I wish he were here
tonight to be able to express that. Be-
cause every time I have been in the
room with him, he has appreciated the
service of our Nation’s 21 million living
veterans.
Madam Speaker, 2 years ago, we had
an opportunity to do something about
it, and, in a bipartisan way—and I do
want to give thanks to both sides of
the aisle. This would not have hap-
pened without their help. We started
on a mission to really reform the way
the VA provides healthcare.
For those out there who don’t know
about our VA system, there are over
150 VA medical centers, over 800 out-
patient clinics that we have.
The VA is divided into, actually,
three parts: It is healthcare, and it is
benefits, and it is cemeteries.
If you haven’t visited a VA cemetery,
you should, because it will really make
your heart feel good to see how we
treat our Nation’s heroes.
We started, 2 years ago, with the idea
that not all employees at work at the
VA are good employees and should be
there. When I got to Congress in 2010—
I have been here, now, 10 years—there
were 250,000 employees at the VA.
Now, the VA employs almost 370,000
people. But there were some egregious
acts that some of these folks had car-
ried out, and they could not be fired.
We passed a bill in a bipartisan way
that allows us to terminate poorly per-
forming employees while maintaining
the rights of those employees who are
there, 99.9 percent of whom are doing a
great job for our Nation’s heroes.
The second thing most of us Con-
gressmen hear about is disability
claims. When I got to Congress in 2009,
there were a million backlogged dis-
ability claims, veterans sometimes
waiting until they died to get their dis-
ability claim adjudicated. That number
now is down to around 350,000—far too
many.
We passed a bill at that point, about
18 months ago, the appeals reform bill,
and it has been piloted—called the
RAMP program—which has sped up.
Last Friday, I was in Nashville, Ten-
nessee, going to our regional office to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1275
January 29, 2019
see how they were doing, and I ran into
a gentleman who was using the VA—
just happened to be there, a veteran,
about my age. He said: ‘‘I have been
trying for 7 years to get my claim adju-
dicated, get taken care of.’’ In 90 days,
with the new RAMP program—he had
waited 7 years. In 90 days, it was
solved.
That program goes live next month.
The Secretary has approved it, and,
hopefully, now we can speed the claims
and appeals process up.
A third bill that we passed, that I
used in 1975 when I got out of the Army
and came back stateside from the
Southeast Asia, is called the GI bill.
For those out there, it is an education
bill, and it was written, initially, by a
World War II vet Harry G. Colmery.
Mr. Colmery wrote a bill and thought
that we could really change our Nation
by educating veterans who were get-
ting out of the military; and we did
just that, and it changed our Nation.
I am still appreciative, to this day, of
the $300 a month that my country in-
vested in me when I had a young fam-
ily, when I went back to finish my edu-
cation at the University of Tennessee,
College of Medicine. I was able to use
that money to help me finish my train-
ing and my education. But that termi-
nated at 10 years. If I didn’t use it
within 10 years, it went away.
Today, we passed a bill, fully paid
for, that allows a veteran to use their
GI bill the rest of their life. And we
know if someone is 23 when they get
out, when they are 40, maybe they
might need retraining. Well, now, they
can get that.
The second thing we did in that bill—
again, very personal to me—is some
veterans hadn’t served long enough. If
they earned a Purple Heart, they didn’t
get the full benefit because they hadn’t
served enough time. Now, if you shed
blood for this Nation, you get the full
GI bill, and it should be that.
We also improved payment for our
Gold Star families and others, and we
have added time for technical training.
We know those courses sometimes take
longer.
We also funded, what is called the
Veterans Choice Program three times
during the last Congress, and that is
how veterans get care outside the VA.
We know that most VA hospitals can’t
provide everything to everybody, and
many veterans have to travel long,
long distances to see a doctor, to see a
specialist.
b 1600
I was visiting Oregon a couple years
ago and found out that one congres-
sional district in Oregon had more
square miles than the State of Ten-
nessee did. We had to develop a bill
that allowed veterans in rural areas to
see a doctor and veterans in urban
areas to do so.
We passed the VA MISSION Act,
which was signed into law, appro-
priately, on June the 6th of 2018, 74
years after D-day.
What this bill will do is the fol-
lowing. It will revise how veterans get
their care outside the VA. It has a sec-
ond very important part called the VA
caregiver bill. Catastrophically in-
jured, post-9/11 GIs who were injured in
battle now can have a caregiver given a
stipend to stay home so that they can
stay out of the hospital.
But that did not apply to pre-9/11 vet-
erans, Vietnam-era veterans like I am,
Korea, and World War II. We now pro-
vide that benefit for those veterans.
Thirdly, we are looking at what is
called an asset review of the VA. This
is something that really surprised me
when I looked at the data. The actual
number of patients in hospital beds
peaked in 1981. The population has
grown 40 percent, and we actually have
10 percent fewer people in hospital beds
than we did almost 40 years ago.
So medicine is changing, and the VA
needs to change. It needs to go through
a self-evaluation, get right-sized, and
get the VA healthcare out where the
patients live, where the veterans are.
We know that patients are moving,
veterans are moving, from the North-
east to the South and West, so we need
to put those assets there. That is what
the VA bill will do.
There are a few other small things,
Madam Speaker, that we did that
might not be big to some people but
were huge to me, because my Scout-
master was killed in 1965 in Vietnam.
His name was Thomas E. Thayer. He
was a first sergeant in the 101st Air-
borne Division, a great man with four
children.
When we have Gold Star families
that sign a lease, let’s say—and we had
this happen where they signed a lease.
One was in North Carolina, and the
person would not release that woman
from her lease, and she had to pay
that.
Now, if you lose your husband or
your wife in combat, you can get out of
those. We also did the same thing for
cable TV, for internet, and for cell
phones. If you are deployed, you can’t
use those things, so you can get out of
those long-term contracts.
The Veterans’ Affairs Committee
passed over 80 bills. Almost 50 of them
were signed into law to help our Na-
tion’s veterans.
We did have one very disappointing
failure to me, and I have already
dropped a bill this term. It is called the
blue water Navy bill. Just to let our
audience out there, the folks viewing
this, know what it is, there are vet-
erans who served on surface ships in
the territorial waters just off Vietnam,
off the coast. Actually, Agent Orange
was used in Korea, where I was. If you
put your boots on the ground, then you
are given the presumption for certain
diseases for disability benefits. That
does not occur for those men and
women who served on surface ships.
We passed it 382–0 in the House and
could not get it moved in the Senate.
We are going to give them an oppor-
tunity to do the right thing this next
Congress.
Madam Speaker, it has been a privi-
lege for me to serve for 10 years on the
House Veterans’ Affairs Committee,
and we are committed in that com-
mittee to continuing to serve our Na-
tion’s heroes and to give them the ben-
efits they have earned that allow us to
be free.
I thank Mr. WALKER for allowing me
a few minutes to come down and share
these few things we did for our Na-
tion’s heroes.
Mr. WALKER. Madam Speaker, I
thank Dr. PHIL ROE for sharing. The
gentleman is one of the heroes around
here. He not only talks the talk, but he
walks the walk.
Speaking of somebody who walks the
walk, that is DAN CRENSHAW from
Texas’ Second District, a 10-year Navy
veteran, a lieutenant commander. He is
one bad dude. I would probably use a
different expression, but my mother
may be watching at this particular
time.
‘‘Saturday Night Live’’ made him fa-
mous, but his work already has put
him out as one of our leaders. It is my
privilege to introduce and to hear from
the former lieutenant commander.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas, Mr. DAN CREN-
SHAW.
Mr. CRENSHAW. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for setting this
up and for having me speak here today.
I rise today to address the urgent
issue of border security. There are two
elements to the border debate. One is
political, and one is policy.
The political element consists of the
circumstances regarding the shutdown,
the negotiations or lack thereof, and
the points of compromise from either
side.
The policy side is simply the ques-
tion of whether or not we need a wall
as part of comprehensive border secu-
rity.
Let me begin with the political
gamesmanship.
Democratic leadership has been run-
ning a victory lap this week because
they ‘‘won’’ the shutdown. I keep won-
dering, what exactly did they win?
If you think winning means a porous
border with 400,000 people apprehended
every year, then your definition of win-
ning is different than mine. If you
think winning means standing strong
against any sort of negotiation or com-
promise that would have allowed Fed-
eral workers finally to be paid, then
your definition of winning is different
than mine.
The President didn’t cave to Demo-
crats. The President gave compassion
to Federal workers who needed it. If
that is your idea of losing, then you
and I have different definitions of what
it means to lose.
The truth is that the President has
compromised time after time because,
for us, this is not about who wins or
loses the political game; it is about se-
curing the border.
First, the President agreed that a
2,000-mile, sea-to-shining-sea wall

would be a logistical difficulty, so he
agreed to 234 miles of fencing, a mere
tenth of his original campaign promise.
Then the President agreed to $5.7 bil-
lion in border wall funding instead of
the originally requested $25 billion, a
fifth of the original request.
Democrats then said that they could
discuss border security only if the gov-
ernment was open, so the President
opened the government.
At every turn, the President has
reached out and compromised in order
to get a deal done. And at every turn,
Democrats scoffed at compromise.
This brings us to the second element
of this great debate, the policy ele-
ment. Democrats have laughed at a
wall. They call it medieval and ineffec-
tive, and they dismiss it without any
rationale or reasoning.
The reality is that walls do work, as
every rational security expert ac-
knowledges. Border agents overwhelm-
ingly attest to this. After all, the
President’s plan came from the experts
at the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity.
An integral part of this multifaceted
plan is a 234-mile border wall. Every-
where we put walls, illegal crossings
drop. Look at San Diego, El Centro,
Tucson, and El Paso. The drop in ille-
gal immigration and apprehensions
after constructing a wall is enormous
and immediate, yet Democrats pretend
these facts don’t exist.
They point to common myths about
how walls function. They like to claim
people will just climb over or tunnel
under them. Oh, yeah? Just like that?
Well, I am a Navy SEAL, and I know
better than most what it takes to infil-
trate hardened areas. I would much
rather be infiltrating a place with no
barriers than one with a giant, 20-plus-
foot wall. The planning considerations,
training, and equipment necessary are
considerable. And, yes, it takes a lot
more than a tall ladder, especially
when discussing huge groups of mi-
grants like the ones we are seeing.
The obvious truth is that walls make
a difference and clearly mitigate move-
ment, and we actually all used to agree
on this.
Democrats claim they are for secu-
rity but would prefer a virtual wall
with sensors, drones, cameras, et
cetera. That is fine, and that is exactly
why that technology is included in our
plan, but to say we need only that
technology is effectively asking our
Border Patrol to chase migrants end-
lessly across large swaths of territory.
It is one thing for a sensor to go off
when we see a group of migrants go by.
But guess what? When we see that go
off, they keep going unimpeded. Asking
our border agents to simply chase them
down when there are literally hundreds
crossing each day is complete insanity.
This dishonest, so-called debate must
end. We must start having serious dis-
cussions and secure our border because
that is what the American people want.
That is what it means to be with the
people.
Mr. WALKER. What a privilege it is
for me to serve with Lieutenant Com-
mander DAN CRENSHAW, two Bronze
Stars a Purple Heart. He has sacrificed
much for this country and serves with
honor and integrity.
Speaking of service, somebody who
serves next door to my district in
North Carolina is the past chairwoman
and top Republican on our Education
and Labor Committee. If there is any-
one who works any harder among the
434, 435 Members, I have not met that
person yet. It is my privilege to honor
and to acknowledge her.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina, Ms.
VIRGINIA FOXX.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I thank the vice chairman of
our conference for his very, very kind
words. We are neighbors in North Caro-
lina, friends, and colleagues here who
are concerned about the very same
issues that face our country.
We are worried about many, many,
many things. We worry about the ab-
sence of a wall. We worry about the
need for more national security. I
know that we also worry and share the
concern with what has happened in this
Chamber in the last few weeks when we
have heard a few loud voices whose
rhetoric has completely departed from
the bipartisan consensus on policy to-
ward Israel.
Just last May, for the 70th anniver-
sary of Israel’s independence, the
House passed, by unanimous consent, a
resolution that I introduced with two
of my Democrat colleagues supporting
robust, bilateral relations with Israel
globally and fairness in its treatment
in multilateral fora.
The House of Representatives unani-
mously sent a message to the U.N. and
the world that respect for Israel’s na-
tional sovereignty and broad recogni-
tion of its statehood is a priority for
U.S. national security and achieving
peace in the Middle East.
Over the past couple weeks, though,
some new Members of this body have
cast a cloud over this Chamber’s long-
time priority of the U.S.-Israel rela-
tionship. It has been suggested that
support for Israel represents a betrayal
of one’s patriotism and that Israel has
no right to exist.
I reject that position. The simple
truth is that, throughout history,
Israel has made numerous concessions
in the pursuit of peace while seeking
only the right to exist. Opponents of
the Jewish state don’t seem to under-
stand that supporting our ally is a
matter of national security.
On that basis, anti-Israel bias runs
counter to advancing our national in-
terests in the Middle East. Perpet-
uating the false narratives that there
is an occupied Palestinian territory
and that the Jewish people do not have
any connection to the land only under-
mine the efforts to bring peace and sta-
bility to the region.
Other statements that Israel has
‘‘hypnotized’’ the world harken back to
an age of extreme insensitivity to
Israel at best and a new acceptance of
anti-Semitic norms at worst.
By our own State Department’s defi-
nition, applying double standards that
require Israel behave in a manner that
is not expected or demanded of any
other democratic nation and denying
the Jewish people their right to self-de-
termination are anti-Semitic beliefs.
We must reject this rhetoric and con-
tinue to support Israel as the major
strategic partner that this body has
long enshrined in our laws, our policy
priorities, and our hearts and minds.
With that, we are also improving our
national security.
Mr. WALKER. Madam Speaker, I
thank Representative FOXX for sharing
her heart and our continued pro-Israel
stance.
There are few who would be able to
speak more to that issue than one of
our two Jewish Members in the House,
the co-chair of the House Republican
Israeli Caucus and an Iraqi war vet-
eran. Some would say he has three
beautiful daughters, but I think he just
married well and has two children. He
serves on our Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee and is a classmate of mine from
the 114th Congress. It is my privilege
to introduce and to hear from him.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York, Mr. LEE
ZELDIN.
b 1615
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I
thank Mr. WALKER for his leadership in
our conference and his great represen-
tation of his district. It is an honor to
be joining the gentleman tonight for
this important time on the House floor.
I come here to appeal to all my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle, Re-
publicans and Democrats, to reject the
anti-Israel and anti-Semitic hatred
that we are starting to see infiltrate
American politics and even the Halls of
Congress.
It is important that we all come to-
gether, that we work together to not
empower, not embrace, not associate
with individuals and rhetoric and pol-
icy that promotes this anti-Israel and
anti-Semitic hatred, but that we reject
it.
It was just a couple weeks ago that
this Chamber came together nearly
unanimously to reject white suprem-
acy. What is taking so long for House
Democratic leadership to schedule a
vote on H. Res. 72 that I introduced
with Congressman BUDD, Congress-
woman STEFANIK, Congressman WALK-
ER as a cosponsor, and others as well?
Why can’t we come together as force-
fully and urgently to reject that anti-
Semitism and that anti-Israel hatred?
We have House Democrats who have
associated with, taken pictures with,
embraced Louis Farrakhan. He said:
‘‘So when they talk about Farrakhan,
call me a hater, you do what they do,
call me an anti-Semite. Stop it, I’m
anti-termite.’’ Louis Farrakhan said
that last year.

He also said: ‘‘Satanic Jews have in-
fected the whole world with poison and
deceit.’’
This is offensive to me, as someone
who is Jewish. But I am talking to col-
leagues who aren’t Jewish, and they
are offended as well by Farrakhan and
the fact that there are Members of this
Chamber who associate with this per-
son.
In 1984, Farrakhan said about Adolph
Hitler: ‘‘He was a very great man.’’
Activist Tamika Mallory called
Louis Farrakhan ‘‘the greatest of all
time.’’ Her fellow organizer, Linda
Sarsour, said: ‘‘Only Jews . . . are ones
that condone violence against Arabs
and are cool with mosques being at-
tacked.’’
I have no problem standing here in
the well of this Chamber rejecting it. I
don’t know what is taking so long for
House Democratic leadership to sched-
ule a vote on H. Res. 72, so they can
join us in condemning it as well.
There is a freshman Representative
from Michigan, Representative
RASHIDA TLAIB, who supports the Boy-
cott, Divestment and Sanctions move-
ment. She invited Abbas Hamideh to
attend her swearing-in events this
month. Abbas said, in 2016: ‘‘Israel does
not have a right to exist. The terrorist
entity is illegal and has no basis to
exist, other than a delusional, ISIS-
like ideology.’’
Also this month, that person said:
‘‘I’m willing to go back to my country
Palestine, if the Zionist terrorists go
back to Poland. Deal? Let’s get that
ball rolling ASAP. Get off Twitter, and
let’s make that happen.’’
This same Representative said of
those who support Israel: ‘‘They forgot
what country they represent.’’
Well, as someone who has been in the
United States Army for over 15 years,
has deployed into combat in defense of
this country, a former Army para-
trooper with the 82nd Airborne Divi-
sion, never once in my life have I for-
gotten what country I represent.
It is kind of ironic that someone who,
on their victory night, wraps them-
selves in the Palestinian flag is trying
to lecture us, especially for supporting
our Nation’s greatest ally in Israel.
The Boycott, Divestment and Sanc-
tions movement is one that is founded
by someone named Omar Barghouti,
who said: ‘‘We are witnessing the rapid
demise of Zionism, and nothing can be
done save it, for Zionism is intent on
killing itself. I, for one, support eutha-
nasia.’’
He also said: ‘‘Many of the methods
of collective and individual ‘punish-
ment’ meted out to Palestinian civil-
ians at the hands of young, racist,
often sadistic and every impervious
Israeli soldiers . . . are reminiscent of
common Nazi practices against the
Jews.’’
So when you are embracing BDS,
know that this is what the founder of
BDS says. This goes beyond anti-Israeli
hatred. It is anti-Semitic hatred.
What is taking so long? This Cham-
ber that had no problem rushing to this
well and nearly unanimously rejecting
white supremacy has a problem reject-
ing this?
Meanwhile, our students, in the name
of the BDS movement, on college cam-
puses all across this entire country, are
being subjected to blatant anti-Semi-
tism.
For example, at New York Univer-
sity, the student government passed a
resolution supporting BDS. The
Bronfman Center for Jewish Life was
temporarily closed in response to
threatening Twitter posts by a student
who expressed ‘‘a desire for Zionists to
die.’’
Other college campuses include a
University of Michigan professor who
refused to write a letter of rec-
ommendation for a qualified student to
study abroad solely because she was
seeking to study abroad in Israel.
A Students for Justice in Palestine
cofounder and University of California,
Berkeley, professor spoke at a national
conference and shared an anti-Semitic
meme of an Orthodox Jewish person in
his presentation.
At Warren Wilson College, an invited
speaker said: ‘‘Jews are doing the same
thing to the Palestinians as the Nazis
did to the Jews.’’
The examples go on, whether it was
Charlottesville, where the leadership
said that Jews must die, that he want-
ed all Jews to die, or whether it was
the shooting that took place in Pitts-
burgh.
We are motivated, my colleagues and
I, to this Chamber to stand against
anti-Israel and anti-Semitic hatred.
Everyone in this Chamber should join
us.
I went kindergarten through 12th
grade, college, law school, 4 years of
Active Duty, and I never once experi-
enced anti-Semitism. It has no busi-
ness infiltrating American politics; it
has no business infiltrating the cam-
puses of United States universities and
colleges; and it has no business infil-
trating the Halls of Congress.
I encourage an immediate vote on H.
Res. 72.
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, you can
see why Representative LEE ZELDIN is
thought so highly of in the United
States House of Congress. I appreciate
his remarks and, even more, his pas-
sion.
When we talk about going through
some tough things in life, I don’t be-
lieve there is anyone that I know who
can relate to the journey that our
whip, Representative STEVE SCALISE,
has been through.
I will never forget getting word that
Thursday, and we did not know for sure
whether Representative SCALISE would
actually make it through the day, but
somehow he did. The thing that I re-
membered most is his gift with policy.
There are lots of things that he does
well. The thing that I will always re-
member is how he let his faith shine
through all of this darkness.
I yield to Louisiana’s finest and our
whip, Representative STEVE SCALISE.
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from North Carolina for
yielding and for bringing attention to
what we are here to talk about tonight.
This would have been the State of
the Union that the President was ini-
tially invited by the Speaker to deliver
back on January 3. I am glad, Mr.
Speaker, that, ultimately, we got a
new date that the Speaker has invited
the President to come to this Chamber,
the people’s House, on February 5,
when President Trump finally will
have the opportunity to address the
people of this country on the state of
Union, as the Constitution prescribes.
We have seen, over time, it has been
done in many different ways. George
Washington started the tradition in
1790 by actually addressing a joint ses-
sion of Congress, as opposed to just
sending a letter. It has been done dif-
ferent ways over time.
But over the last 50 years, it has been
done here in this House Chamber every
single year, and I am glad that we will
finally have that opportunity to see
the tradition continue.
Mr. Speaker, when you talk about
the state of the Union and some of the
things that President Trump has been
fighting for, the main things he has
been fighting for are to deliver to the
American people on getting the econ-
omy back on track and keeping Amer-
ica safe.
Part of keeping America safe, Mr.
Speaker, means securing America’s
border. That is really what was at the
heart of the fight over the last month
of this government shutdown.
A lot of people in Washington are so
focused, Mr. Speaker, on who is to
blame or who won the week, who is the
winner or who is the loser. You hear
everybody saying that, okay, well,
NANCY PELOSI was able to hold the
State of the Union hostage and some-
how that is a victory for the American
people that she denied the President
the ability to come here to the people’s
House to share his message.
I wouldn’t be bragging about that as
a victory if I were Speaker PELOSI, be-
cause, ultimately, what that means is
that she is afraid of having the Amer-
ican people hear the message that
President Trump had to say.
That message will be distributed next
week, but part of that message in-
volves why we need to secure the bor-
der. That is really at the heart of this
debate.
Why do we need to secure America’s
border? There are some people ques-
tioning whether or not we need to se-
cure America’s border. The good news,
Mr. Speaker, is that there are not
many people in this country that won-
der whether or not we should secure
the border. The bad news is that of the
few people who are in that category,
one of them is the Speaker of the
House of Representatives.
We are going to continue to have this
debate. On February 5, when you hear
President Trump give this message, I
am sure some of the things we are

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1278 January 29, 2019
going to hear are the horror stories
that we have had because we don’t
have a secure border.
I have experienced something, and I
have heard firsthand from constituents
in my district about what is at stake.
I had the opportunity to get a call from
the mother of a fire chief in south Lou-
isiana, Spencer Chauvin.
Spencer Chauvin was responding to a
call, like he did. He was a public serv-
ant, a fire chief in St. John the Baptist
Parish. As he was responding to that
call, Mr. Speaker, he was killed by
someone who is in this country ille-
gally.
He never got to go home that night
to his 6-year-old and 8-year-old. He
doesn’t get to talk to his mother any-
more.
But after his mother and I talked,
she mailed me this just last week, Mr.
Speaker, and it is a coin. It is a coin in
tribute to Spencer Chauvin. I keep this
coin with me as a reminder of what is
at stake in human terms, because we
could talk about who won the day or
who won the week, but is it really vic-
tory when the result of Speaker
PELOSI’s victory is that there may be
more victims like Spencer Chauvin
across this country because we haven’t
secured our border?
President Trump didn’t campaign
saying he needed $5.7 billion to build a
wall. President Trump talked about
building a wall to secure our border.
When he became President, the experts
who risk their lives, men and women
who are not partisans, men and women
who wake up every day, whether it was
Barack Obama President or whether it
is Donald Trump President, they just
go to the border and risk their lives to
keep the bad people out.
There is a way for good people to
come in. If you want to come in legally
like a million people every single year
who we let in our country legally,
there is a legal way to do it. If you are
seeking asylum from around the world,
Mr. Speaker, there is a legal way to do
it.
In fact, this caravan that you saw
coming into America, they stormed
through Mexico’s border on the south-
ern border of Mexico. They stormed
through that border. They wanted to
storm through our border because we
don’t have a physical barrier. They
were offered asylum by Mexico, and
they were offered work permits by
Mexico, and they turned that down.
Are you really an asylum seeker if
you turn down asylum along the way
here? It is not about asylum. It is
about whether or not we are going to
get back to rule of law and secure our
border.
The experts who risk their lives say
it is going to cost $5.7 billion to secure
our border, to give them the tools they
need, and that includes a physical bar-
rier.
Now that we are seeing a growing list
of Democrats, including the majority
leader, STENY HOYER, say physical bar-
riers ought to be part of the solution,
in conclusion, Mr. Speaker, what I
would say, when we open back the peo-
ple’s House to the President on Feb-
ruary 5, is let’s heed the call of Repub-
licans and Democrats alike who recog-
nize we need to secure our southern
border so that we can get back to rule
of law and prevent more Spencer
Chauvins from becoming victims to an
open border.
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Mr. Whip, Representative STEVE SCA-
LISE, for his example and courage in
standing up for what is right and true.
Many Members whom I have run
across in this House are studious in
their work, but I don’t know of any
more than Representative GARY PALM-
ER.
In this town, there is probably a din-
ner every night somewhere. Mr. PALM-
ER chooses to take his time going back
to his office, preparing for the next
day, constantly reading and staying in-
formed.
I was born in the State that he rep-
resents. I lived there only 6 months. We
have a mutual love for the Crimson
Tide. It is my privilege to acknowledge
and yield to Representative GARY
PALMER from Alabama.
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman. The gentleman just ac-
knowledged that I have no social life,
but that is fine.
I want to talk a little bit about
healthcare. Here is a fact that my
Democratic colleagues were des-
perately trying to keep from the pub-
lic. Not only do the Republicans sup-
port providing health insurance cov-
erage for those with preexisting condi-
tions, but we actually passed legisla-
tion that did just that with the Amer-
ican Health Care Act of 2017.
It included an amendment that Rep-
resentative DAVID SCHWEIKERT of Ari-
zona and I introduced that ensured
that anyone with a preexisting condi-
tion could purchase health insurance.
The Palmer-Schweikert amendment es-
tablished a risk-sharing plan that
would allow any individual with a pre-
existing condition to purchase insur-
ance at the same price as a healthy in-
dividual.
It was actually modeled after a suc-
cessful State-based program in the
State of Maine. Instead of billions of
dollars being paid out by the Federal
Government in bailouts for health in-
surance companies, our plan, funded by
having the majority of the premiums
paid for those with preexisting condi-
tions, transferred into a fund, a risk-
sharing fund.
This represents an alternative ap-
proach to ObamaCare’s guaranteed
issue provision, which priced everyone
as sick, resulting in far higher pre-
miums. As a matter of fact, the pre-
miums got so high that insurance com-
panies literally began pulling out of
whole States.
What our amendment did was, if
someone had a preexisting condition,
they would come to an insurance com-
pany, fill out a health survey, mark
down if they had had a heart attack or
cancer. The insurance company would
sell them insurance at the same price
as anybody else. But when they paid
their premiums, 90 percent of the pre-
miums would go into this risk-sharing
agreement.
b 1630
The insurance company would only
keep 10 percent. Now, if the person, the
individual became very sick, if it be-
came very expensive, the insurance
company would pay the first $7,500 and
then 10 percent of the next $25,000, so
the most that they were out was
$10,000. The risk-sharing plan would
pick up the balance and reimburse the
providers at the same rate as Medicare.
The way this worked was not only
did the premiums go into the risk-shar-
ing plan, 90 percent of the premiums,
but the rest of us would pay anywhere
from $5 to $10 a month on our pre-
miums. That would go into the risk-
sharing plan, and our amendment was
backed up with $38 billion.
What this allowed us to do was create
a situation where the actuaries could
actually be more predictive in what the
cost would be; and, as a result, it low-
ered premiums for everyone. So not
only did it cover people with pre-
existing conditions, but everyone else’s
premiums came down.
As a matter of fact, in that 20- to 30-
year-old age group, it came down 41
percent; 30 to 40 years old came down
33 percent; 40 to 50, 25 percent; 50 to 60,
11.6 percent; and that pre-Medicare 60
to 65 came down 5.9 percent. So what
we were doing was trying to repair the
American healthcare system, doing it
in a way that made sense for people.
Not only that, we have other options
that we want to present. For instance,
one of the biggest uninsured popu-
lations is young people. It doesn’t
make sense to spend the amount of
money you have to spend to pay your
premiums when a lot of those folks are
earning lower wages.
So we want to set up a plan where
you could buy short-term insurance,
buy what you need, what you can af-
ford for that time in your life, and it
would be for 1 year. Depending on what
you bought, your premiums could come
down 85 percent. If you needed to ex-
tend it, you could extend it for another
3 years. That is transition insurance.
In addition to that, the vast majority
of people in America who have a job
work for a small business, and small
businesses aren’t part of a larger
group. So we wanted to set up associa-
tion group plans so that if you are a
small business and your city set up an
association group plan, you could be in
that. Or if you are a farmer, you could
be a member of an association group
plan that the Farm Bureau established,
and premiums there are projected to
come down by as much as 50 percent.
The Republicans have the best ideas
for repairing our healthcare system,
making it affordable, and keeping our
promise, a promise that was broken re-
peatedly: If you like your doctor, you

can keep your doctor. If you like your
insurance, you can keep your doctor.
It is not just about the cost. It is
about improving outcomes and helping
people live better and healthier.
Mr. WALKER. Madam Speaker, as I
enter my fifth year serving in these
hallowed Halls, I am still in awe of the
sacred duty we have been given. We are
truly the people’s House. However, I
believe that the people’s House should
give a voice to every single American,
including the unborn.
This past Congress, we were able to
pass, in the House, two major bills pro-
tecting life. The Born-Alive Protection
Act and the Pain-Capable Child Protec-
tion Act both affirmed the humanity of
the unborn and our firm belief that
they are worthy of protection. Sadly,
these bills were not taken up in the
Senate, and with the new Democratic-
led House, their future is uncertain.
But each January gives us hope. It is
a critical time to talk about the impor-
tance of life and what it means to all
Americans. Not only does the begin-
ning of the year bring new goals and
ambitions, but it contains important
events that celebrate life, justice, and
human potential.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., whose
life we recently celebrated, knew this
potential. He said that any person can-
not succeed if he or she is willing to
‘‘sacrifice the future of his children for
immediate personal comfort.’’ He also
professed the value and hope of every
single human life.
We also witnessed tens of thousands
of marchers just recently arriving from
all across America to march and boldly
speak for those who can’t speak for
themselves.
Last week, we saw what my friend
Benjamin Watson says is a ‘‘sad and
evil day.’’ Throughout history, there
are pivotal moments that sober us up
to the point of engagement. Such a mo-
ment happened 1 week ago as we
watched the New York State Assembly
celebrate expanding the path for late-
term abortions in their State.
Mr. Watson said this: ‘‘It is a sad and
evil day when the murder of our most
innocent and vulnerable is celebrated
with such overwhelming exuberance.’’
This law allows for abortion up to
birth, practically without limits. It au-
thorizes the legal murder of a fully via-
ble human baby. This is what was
being celebrated. This is why the Free-
dom Tower was lit bright pink on a
cold winter’s night.
That celebration is now seared into
our Nation’s conscience, and many are
now realizing, more than ever, that we
should not, that we must not, that we
cannot look the other way. Even our
sleeping churches are beginning to
awaken to this just and righteous
cause.
New York already faces a cataclysm.
In New York City, more than 500 abor-
tions are performed for every 1,000
births. These numbers are more stag-
gering for African American babies,
more of whom are now aborted than ac-
tually born.
The Governor of New York has even
suggested that those who are pro-life
are not—and get this—welcome in his
State.
I support federalism and the idea
that New York can make its own laws
for New York. My question is not a
legal one, but a moral one. How long
will our American society allow this
injustice? Can we expect the new House
Democratic majority to continue down
this path? Will there be consequences?
As my friend Kay Cole James likes to
say: ‘‘The right to life is the most fun-
damental of all civil rights.’’
To revive the American Dream, we
must reclaim America’s soul. That
means standing with the majority of
the American people who reject the
Federal funding abortions; that means
putting the life and health of women
and babies ahead of the desires of abor-
tion giants like Planned Parenthood.
But in many cases, we must also re-
gain our credibility in valuing the
birth at all stages of life. Do we care—
tough question. Do we care, 20 weeks
after the baby is born, as much as we
value the baby 20 weeks before birth?
In closing, Mark Twain said this: The
two most important days are when you
are born and when you find out why.
How many babies, how many children
will never get to discover either?
Please continue to stand for those
who have no voice. In the name that is
everything just, never stop raising
yours.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
f
PUT A BORDER SECURITY PLAN
ON THE FLOOR
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Florida (Mr. GAETZ)
for 30 minutes.
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, here we
are, 21⁄2 weeks away from a potential
government shutdown. It is not 5 yet,
and I am on the floor of the House of
Representatives of the United States
Congress, and there is functionally no-
body here. I choose to address the body
from the podium, rather than the well,
to illustrate this point.
Now, anywhere else in America, if
you were facing some cataclysmic
event like a shutdown or a shutoff or a
business losing a major client, you
would have the whole team here work-
ing, getting together, workshopping so-
lutions, offering amendments, ripening
proposals and actually doing the work
that we are supposed to be doing for
the country.
With this 21⁄2 weeks to the shutdown,
it is notable to me that Congress got
into town last night and we are leaving
tomorrow. It is like we have got the
French workweek around here. And the
Democrats are in control. They are
driving, Madam Speaker.
So my call is to Speaker PELOSI:
If you have got a border security
package, put it on the floor.
If you have got an idea on how to
make sure that our country is safer, re-
specting the rule of law, creating a cli-
mate of rising wages for our workers,
making sure that people in their neigh-
borhoods are safe and not having to
face the gangs and the cartels and the
criminals and MS–13, let’s see it.
Democrats often were right to criti-
cize Republicans during the 115th Con-
gress that we had constrained rules,
limited debates. We had diminished op-
portunity for Members to offer amend-
ments. But we don’t even have a bill. It
kind of makes me wonder why.
It may be the Democrats can come to
no consensus on border security. I
mean, heck, we have got a group of
them who probably are from Rust Belt
States, from the Midwest, where a lot
of their constituents voted for Presi-
dent Trump and believe that we ought
to have physical barriers, believe that
we ought to be a nation of laws and
borders—pretty rational stuff. And
then you have got this other wing of
the Democratic Party, Madam Speak-
er, that thinks that walls and borders
are racist and immoral.
How is it that the country is expect-
ing us to lead—you to lead, in the ma-
jority—if we aren’t able to at least
come to this floor and offer concrete
solutions?
You know what we voted on these
last couple of days? We have been vot-
ing on whether or not we are going to
establish studies on the potential
harms of cryptocurrency. Now, that
may be a virtuous objective, but it
seems less poignant and less timely
than the impending shutdown we po-
tentially have in 21⁄2 weeks.
We took votes on whether or not the
Department of Homeland Security
should offer more mentorship and
training to law enforcement on Tribal
lands—also virtuous, but certainly not
what we ought to be doing here.
Madam Speaker, each and every day,
when we walk these Halls, we stand
under the busts and statues and murals
of some of the greatest Americans to
have ever lived. There are times when
I feel we are unworthy to cast our gaze
upon them and upon their likeness be-
cause here we are, trusted to fulfill the
promise of the country, and it is not
even 5 yet on a workday, and I am the
only one here and everybody is packing
their bags getting ready to go home.
It is a travesty and it is a shame
brought upon this House. I certainly

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
hundreds of thousands of Federal work-
ers are, thank God, returning to work
this week to tackle a backlog that has
been building for over a month. Over
that time, the U.S. economy suffered a
loss of $11 billion, according to the non-
partisan Congressional Budget Office—
$11 billion for the President’s temper
tantrum, including $3 billion that can
never be recovered. That is an expen-
sive temper tantrum. The individual
costs are even harder than the big
numbers.
Who knows how many Federal work-
ers missed a doctor’s appointment or
fell behind on their payments because
they weren’t getting their paychecks.
Federal contractors will not get back-
pay and may have lost health insur-
ance entirely during the shutdown.
Senator SMITH is working on legisla-
tion to fix that problem.
While even Federal employees and
contractors are returning to work,
they still might be digging out of the
hole that the Trump shutdown put
them in. I hope this serves as a lesson
to President Trump and all of my Re-
publican colleagues—no more shut-
down. We cannot repeat this same
nightmare scenario in 3 weeks when
the CR expires. We Democrats will not
shut down the government. We hope
President Trump has learned his les-
son. He touched a very hot stove. We
hope our Republican colleagues will
join us, as they did last Thursday, to
make sure there is no shutdown.
Thankfully, I have heard several of my
colleagues say that. A number of them,
including some of the most senior Re-
publicans, have said we shouldn’t have
another shutdown. So we look forward
to working with you to avoid that in
every possible way.
The House and Senate conferees
should strive, instead, to find common
ground where it already exists and
build from there. The good news is they
begin with plenty to work with. Demo-
crats and Republicans agree on the
need for stronger border security meas-
ures at our ports of entry as well as the
need for more humanitarian assistance.
That is a good place to start.
Plenty of column inches have been
dedicated to the discussion of areas
where Republicans and Democrats have
friction, but several times over the
past 2 years, Congress has come to-
gether to reach big compromises, in-
cluding two budget agreements and a
landmark Russia sanctions bill. The
common theme of those agreements is
that the President stayed out of the

negotiations. Because President Trump
gave Congress space to find a deal on
our own, we were able to strike an ac-
cord. That is what we will need again if
the conference committee is to suc-
ceed, because the President has no un-
derstanding of what the realities are in
this Senate and in the House and no
consistency in what he says one day
and what he says the next. As I said,
negotiating with President Trump is
like negotiating with Jell-O.
So let Democrats and Republicans,
the House and Senate, come to an
agreement, and my guess is we can
avoid a shutdown.
HUAWEI
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, yesterday afternoon, the Depart-
ment of Justice unveiled nearly two
dozen charges against the Chinese
telecom Huawei in two indictments—
one for the evasion of sanctions on Iran
and another for its attempts to steal
sensitive intellectual property from T-
Mobile in the United States.
I am so glad the Justice Department
announced these indictments yester-
day. China has been flouting inter-
national sanction laws and, even worse,
stealing IP and know-how for the last
decade. State-connected telecom giants
like Huawei are an example of how
China operates. They are not the ex-
ception. They are the rule in China.
When China wants to supplant U.S.
dominance in an emerging industry, it
acts rapaciously. It steals. Our law en-
forcement needs to be especially vigi-
lant with Chinese telecom companies
such as Huawei and CTE, which intend
to displace U.S. communications net-
works with their own 5G networks be-
cause those could give China access to
all kinds of sensitive information. U.S.
authorities should be prosecuting
Huawei’s criminal violations to the
fullest extent of the law. I give the ad-
ministration credit for having this suit
go forward, but my message to Presi-
dent Trump now is this: Don’t back
down. While the Trump administration
has shown signs of being tougher on
China than either the Bush or Obama
administration—which I commend
them—President Trump has also tried
the conciliatory approach, particularly
at the moment when the administra-
tion is engaged in negotiations with
the Chinese.
Just last year, President Trump let
ZTE, another state-backed Chinese
telecom that violated trade sanctions,
off the hook in the hopes of achieving
concessions from China on North Korea
that never materialized. In December,
the President said he would ‘‘certainly
intervene’’ in the Huawei case if he
thought it were necessary to achieve a
trade deal with China.
President Trump, do not make the
same mistake you made with ZTE by
interfering with the Justice Depart-
ment’s prosecution of Huawei. The
United States should not make any
concessions unless and until China
makes credible and enforceable com-
mitments to end all forms of theft and
extortion of American intellectual
property, which is exactly what
Huawei is accused of.
KOCH BROTHERS
Madam President, finally, a com-
ment on the Koch brothers. I read a
column with interest today in the
Washington Post. The Koch network
has been trying to rebrand itself as less
partisan. They are saying: Let’s bring
us together. Let’s work with both
sides.
That is a good instinct, but color me
skeptical. The Koch brothers may sit
out the Presidential contest, as they
did in 2016, but their political arm,
Americans for Prosperity, continues to
support candidates who are divisive,
who do not bring us together. Some of
the ads you see, the very candidates
they support, are dividing us. You
can’t, on the one hand, say you want to
bring us together and use your polit-
ical arm to tear us apart. Yet that is
what the Koch brothers are doing.
They support the kind of judges who
agree with them on all the corporate
stuff. They don’t want regulation, but
they are against voting rights. How
does that bring us together? They are
against immigrants. How does that
bring us together? At the State level,
the Koch brothers’ network of affili-
ates continues to support so many dif-
ferent initiatives that divide us.
Through support for shadowy think
tanks and pseudoacademic institu-
tions, the Koch brothers continue to
fund studies that sow doubt about cli-
mate change and evangelize deregula-
tion.
It seems their highest priority is still
to help the rich and powerful, no mat-
ter how divisive it is, as long as we can
get our corporate taxes cut even fur-
ther, cut the taxes for the wealthy, and
stop the protections by preventing gov-
ernment regulations for average folks.
As long as they do that, all this talk
about coming together and supporting
an occasional bill here and there
doesn’t mean much.
I hope that this beginning of what
the Koch brothers say spreads. I hope it
is not just sort of a figleaf because they
are getting such bad publicity, and
America is moving so far away from
what they believe.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.
GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, for
weeks, Democrats repeated the same
refrain: Open the government, and we
will negotiate on border security.
On Friday, the government was re-
opened. Now it is time for Democrats
to honor their promise and work with
Republicans to provide adequate fund-
ing to address the security and human-
itarian crisis at our border. The next 3
weeks will be a test of Democrats’ seri-
ousness about legislating. Do they real-
ly want to work with Republicans and
the President on solutions? Are they
willing to actually negotiate, which in-
volves both sides making compromises,
or are they more interested in obstruc-
tion? That is the question before the
House.
Are they in Congress because they
actually want to find solutions to chal-
lenges facing our country or are they
here to score political points and op-
pose everything the President says or
does? The answers should become pret-
ty clear over the next 3 weeks. If
Democrats meant what they said about
negotiating on border security, we
could produce a bill that will fulfill our
responsibility to protect our borders.
Make no mistake, it is a responsibility.
Perhaps our greatest obligation as
Members of Congress is to provide the
funding and resources necessary to
keep our Nation secure. No nation can
be safe if it doesn’t know who is com-
ing across its borders.
Right now, we are facing a security
crisis at our Nation’s border. Tens of
thousands of individuals try to cross
our southern border illegally every sin-
gle month. Illegal drugs flow into this
country through ports of entry and un-
secured areas of the border. The holes
in our border security leave us suscep-
tible to illegal entry by gang members,
human traffickers, drug dealers, terror-
ists, weapons traffickers, and more.
The flood of illegal immigration has
also created a humanitarian crisis. In-
dividuals attempting the journey to
come here illegally are vulnerable to
exploitation, illness, and abuse. Ap-
proximately, one out of every three
women attempting the journey to the
United States is sexually assaulted.
Roughly, 70 percent of individuals be-
come victims of violence along their
way. Illness and other medical issues
are also a serious problem. By failing
to discourage illegal immigration, we
are perpetuating this humanitarian
crisis.
I hope, over the next 3 weeks, Demo-
crats will honor their promise and
come to the table on border security
legislation in a real way, ready to en-
gage in genuine negotiation and com-
promise so we can really address this
crisis at our border.
S. 1
Last night, we moved to debate on a
package of four bills related to U.S.
policy in the Middle East. The Senate
attempted to consider these bills ear-
lier this month, but Democrats
inexplicably chose to block these bi-
partisan pieces of legislation on three
different occasions—three times. I am
hopeful their decision last night to fi-
nally support consideration of these
bills is a good sign that they are ready
to turn to legislating instead of poli-
ticking.
The bill package before us this week
addresses a number of key issues.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S727
January 29, 2019
First, it will further strengthen our re-
lationship with Israel, our closest ally
in the Middle East. It authorizes 10
years of military assistance funding for
Israel and reaffirms our commitment
to ensuring that Israel has better
weapons and equipment than its en-
emies. It will also foster increased
technological cooperation between
Israel and the United States to support
the security of both our countries.
This legislation will also strengthen
our relationship with another impor-
tant ally of ours in the Middle East,
and that is the Kingdom of Jordan. At
a time when Jordan is facing security
and humanitarian challenges stem-
ming from the conflict in Syria, it is
particularly important that we reaf-
firm our commitment to this key ally.
This legislation will also help hold ac-
countable individuals who supported
the atrocities of the Assad regime in
Syria. It directs the Treasury Depart-
ment to investigate whether the Cen-
tral Bank of Syria launders money for
the Syrian Government. Finally, this
legislation will protect the rights of
State and local governments to decline
to do business with entities that have
chosen to boycott Israel.
I am glad we finally moved on to
these important bills, and I look for-
ward to voting for their final passage,
hopefully, in the very near future.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
SCOTT of Florida). Without objection,
it is so ordered.
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I
come to the Senate floor today with a
sense of great disappointment—dis-
appointment in what my colleague, the
senior Senator from Florida, and the
Republican leader have done with the
bill before us today. They have taken a
bill that had broad bipartisan sup-
port—maybe unanimous bipartisan
support—and tried to turn it into a po-
litical weapon. In the process, they are
doing a great disservice to the Amer-
ican people and to all of us who value
the tradition of strong, bipartisan sup-
port for our friend and ally Israel.
I am a cosponsor of the original bill,
S. 2497, entitled the ‘‘United States-
Israel Security Assistance Authoriza-
tion Act of 2018.’’ It is a bill to codify
the memorandum of understanding be-
tween the United States and Israel. It
was forged under President Obama and
provides Israel with $38 billion in secu-
rity assistance over the next 10 years.
This includes $33 billion in foreign
military financing funds to Israel and
$5 billion in missile defense assistance
for the Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and
Arrow 3.
That is a lot of money when you con-
sider the many priorities we have here
at home and abroad. In fact, more than
one-half of our entire global foreign
military financing—the security assist-
ance we provide to all of our partners
and allies around the world—goes to
Israel. In my view, that is an impor-
tant investment. It is an important in-
vestment to support our friend and our
democratic ally Israel from the many
threats it faces in a very dangerous
neighborhood—threats from Iran,
Syria, Hezbollah, Hamas, and many
others.
We need to make sure Israel main-
tains a strong military edge to defend
itself, and that is why there was strong
bipartisan support for that original
bill. But then the Republican leader
took a bill with broad bipartisan sup-
port for Israel and added a provision
designed to retaliate against American
citizens who express their disagree-
ment with certain policies of the Gov-
ernment of Israel by participating in
certain boycott activities. Specifically,
the Senator from Florida added a pro-
vision that encourages States through-
out the country to pass laws to punish
American citizens who choose to pro-
test the settlement policies of the gov-
ernment of Prime Minister Netanyahu
by either boycotting products made in
Israeli settlements in the West Bank or
by not otherwise engaging in com-
merce with such settlements.
I want to make this clear. While I
disagree with some of the policies
adopted by the Netanyahu government
in Israel, I do not—I do not—in any
way support a boycott as a method of
expressing those disagreements. Let
me be equally clear. I will fiercely de-
fend the constitutional right of any
American citizen to express his or her
views in such a peaceful way if they so
choose, just as I would support the
right of every American to engage in
other political boycotts to peacefully
express their political views without
fear of being punished by their govern-
ment.
The Senator from Florida and appar-
ently the Republican leader want to
use the power of the State to punish
American citizens who disagree with
them on this issue. It is right here in
the bill. Let me read some of the rel-
evant parts of the bill that is before us
today: A State may adopt and enforce
measures . . . to restrict contracting
by the State for goods and services
with any entity that . . . knowingly
engages in . . . boycott activity . . . in-
tended to limit commercial relations
with Israel or persons doing business in
Israel or Israeli-controlled territories
for purposes of imposing policy posi-
tions on the Government of Israel.
How does this new provision encour-
age States to retaliate against Amer-
ican citizens? It is pretty clear from
that language. It encourages States to
pass laws to deny citizens the right to
bid on any State contract unless—un-
less—those citizens sign an oath stat-
ing that they do not or will not engage
in any boycott of Israel, including any
boycott related to the sale or purchase
of goods or services from Israeli settle-
ments in the West Bank.
Think about that. Let’s say you are
an American citizen living in my State
of Maryland. Let’s say you own a com-
puter consulting business, and you hap-
pen to disagree with Israeli Prime Min-
ister Netanyahu’s government policy of
expanding settlements on the West
Bank near the city of Bethlehem, and
you want to express your opposition to
that policy. Let’s say you choose to
protest that policy by deciding that
you will not provide your services to
businesses located in those settlements
on the West Bank. If you did that, you
would be prohibited by these State
laws from bidding on a contract to pro-
vide computer consulting services to a
Maryland State agency. Think about
that. You may run the best computer
consulting business in the State of
Maryland, but if you don’t sign an oath
renouncing your right to engage in a
boycott, you cannot win any contract
with the State. In other words, even if
you were the best, most qualified bid-
der, you would be disqualified from
winning that State contract because of
your peaceful political activity, having
nothing to do with your ability to ful-
fill the contract. Does that sound un-
constitutional? Yes, it is blatantly un-
constitutional. And guess what. That is
what two Federal courts have already
concluded about State laws that al-
ready do what Senator RUBIO’s bill is
proposing. I am going to review those
decisions in a moment, but before I do,
let me respond to the very flimsy de-
fense the senior Senator from Florida
and others have offered to try to jus-
tify this effort to punish free expres-
sion.
Here is what Senator RUBIO tweeted:
‘‘Opposition to our bill isn’t about
FREE speech. Companies are FREE to
boycott Israel. But local & state gov-
ernments should be FREE to end con-
tracts with companies that do.’’
This reflects a profound misunder-
standing of the First Amendment. It
turns the First Amendment on its
head. It is like saying to our fellow
Americans: You are free to peacefully
express yourselves however you want,
but the government is then free to use
the power of the State to punish you
for doing so. You are free to express
your political opinions, but if we don’t
like what you say, the State is free to
pass laws to prevent you from doing
any business with the State.
That is State-sponsored discrimina-
tion against disfavored political ex-
pression.
I would remind my colleagues that
the First Amendment is not designed
to protect the government from its
citizens; it is designed to protect citi-
zens who may engage in unpopular
speech from retaliation by the govern-
ment.
What if a State passed a law to penal-
ize gun control advocates who boy-
cotted stores that sold semiautomatic
weapons? What if a State retaliated
against anti-abortion activists who

boycotted health clinics that provided
abortion services? We would all agree
that is blatantly unconstitutional.
Senator RUBIO’s proposal and the pro-
posal advanced by the Republican lead-
er is a textbook example of why we
have a First Amendment.
I have heard others defend this meas-
ure by saying: ‘‘It is simply a law to
boycott the boycotters.’’ That is a cute
slogan but, again, shows a stunning ig-
norance of the First Amendment.
Yes, any of us as individuals can al-
ways decide to boycott those whose
boycotts we disagree with. Each of us
as individuals is free to boycott those
businesses that choose to boycott
Israeli settlements in the West Bank,
but that is not what this bill does. This
bill calls upon States to use the power
of the State, to use the power of gov-
ernment to punish peaceful political
actions that we don’t like. Again, that
is patently unconstitutional.
That is the conclusion reached by
two Federal courts that struck down
the kinds of State laws Senator RUBIO
and others seek to promote.
In Kansas, a Federal judge blocked
the enforcement of a State law requir-
ing any State contractor to submit a
written certification that they are
‘‘not currently engaged in a boycott of
Israel.’’
In the Kansas case, a woman who
served as a public school math teacher
for 9 years was barred from partici-
pating in a State-sponsored teacher
training program because she refused
to sign a certification that she wasn’t
participating in a boycott of Israel.
The court found that the anti-boy-
cott certification requirement was de-
signed to suppress political speech and
was, according to the court, ‘‘plainly
unconstitutional.’’ In his opinion, the
judge wrote: ‘‘The Supreme Court has
held that the First Amendment pro-
tects the right to participate in a boy-
cott like the one punished by the Kan-
sas law.’’ That is what the Federal dis-
trict court judge stated.
In Arizona, a Federal court blocked a
State law requiring contractors to cer-
tify that they will not boycott Israel,
finding, again, that the law violates
the right of free speech.
In this case, an attorney contracted
with the Arizona State government to
provide legal services to help individ-
uals in prison. Because of his political
views, the attorney refused to purchase
goods from businesses supporting
Israeli settlements in the West Bank.
Because he would not submit to a writ-
ten certification that he wasn’t boy-
cotting Israel, he was barred from con-
tracting with the State to provide legal
services.
In this Arizona case, the court held
that ‘‘a restriction on one’s ability to
participate in collective calls to oppose
Israel unquestionably burdens the pro-
tected expression of companies wishing
to engage in a boycott. The type of col-
lective action targeted by the [law]
specifically implicates the rights of as-
sembly and association that Americans
and Arizonans use ‘to bring about po-
litical, social, and economic change.’ ’’
There are a number of other chal-
lenges to laws requiring government
contractors to certify they are not boy-
cotting Israel or Israeli settlements on
the grounds that they violate Ameri-
can’s fundamental right to free
speech—a right that Americans have
even when their speech is not sup-
ported by a majority of us. That is the
whole purpose of the First Amendment.
In Texas, there are two pending First
Amendment challenges to a law requir-
ing State contractors to certify they
will not boycott Israel or its settle-
ments. In the first Texas lawsuit, four
individuals were required to choose be-
tween signing a certification that they
are not participating in a peaceful boy-
cott or losing income and other profes-
sional opportunities. These individuals
include a freelance writer who lost two
service contracts from the University
of Houston; a reporter who was forced
to sign the certification against his
conscience in order to keep his job; and
a Ph.D. candidate at Rice University
who was forced to forfeit payment for
judging at a debate tournament. It
caused a student at Texas State Uni-
versity to forgo opportunities to judge
high school debate tournaments.
In the second lawsuit, a Texas speech
pathologist who had worked with de-
velopmentally disabled autistic and
speech impaired elementary school op-
portunities for 9 years was fired be-
cause she refused to sign an addendum
to her contract renewal saying she
would not boycott Israel or Israeli set-
tlements.
In my home State of Maryland, a
software engineer is challenging an ex-
ecutive order requiring contractors to
certify in writing that they are not
boycotting Israel or its settlements. In
that case, the individual was barred
from bidding on government software
program contracts because he would
not sign such a certification.
These laws are blatantly unconstitu-
tional.
Let me speak briefly to a recent
court decision in Arkansas in which a
Federal district court judge ruled in
favor of a State law prohibiting Arkan-
sas from contracting with or investing
in individuals or firms that boycott
Israel or its settlements.
This district court decision is des-
tined for the dustbin of history. I am
not sure any Senator on either side of
the aisle wants to be associated with
its holding.
It concludes that a boycott ‘‘is not
speech, inherently expressive activity,
or subject to constitutional protec-
tion.’’ The banner right there on page 9
of the judge’s opinion reads: ‘‘A Boy-
cott is Neither Speech Nor Inherently
Expressive Conduct.’’ In other words,
according to that district judge, States
can pass laws banning or penalizing
boycotts they don’t like.
Years ago—and it was many years
ago—as a college student, I was active
in the movement to get companies to
divest from South Africa and boy-
cotting companies that did business
with the apartheid regime in South Af-
rica. Under the Arkansas court deci-
sion, a State could pass a law that
would ban that conduct or would at
least penalize me if I wanted to do
business with the State as a sole pro-
prietor and sought State contracts.
There is no doubt that the Arkansas
decision will be overturned. The Su-
preme Court explicitly held in the case
of the NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware
that the First Amendment protects the
right to participate in a boycott for po-
litical purposes. The judge in the Ar-
kansas case attempts to narrow that
NAACP holding in a way that is clearly
inconsistent with First Amendment
protections. I urge my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle to read all three
Federal district court decisions from
Kansas, Arizona, and Arkansas.
As I said earlier, I do not support the
boycott of Israel as a means of pressing
the Netanyahu government to change
some of its policies. There are much
better ways. We have to try to encour-
age our friend and ally to change some
of the policies they disagree with.
Here is what I predict: I predict that
the boycott movement will continue to
grow for a number of reasons. At the
top of that list is the fact that the
Trump administration’s actions, and
inactions, are adding oxygen to the
boycott movement.
To start, the Trump administration
has abandoned any pretense of trying
to prevent the expansion of Israeli set-
tlements in new parts of the West
Bank. There has been a big jump in the
number of tenders and settlement
plans since President Trump took of-
fice. In fact, our Ambassador there,
Ambassador Freidman, has been a
vocal cheerleader for additional settle-
ments in new areas on the West Bank.
In doing so, the Trump administration
has abandoned what has been a long-
held bipartisan position of the U.S.
Government. Here are a few statements
from Presidents of both parties over
the last 40 years:
President Ronald Reagan, in 1982,
said that ‘‘settlement activity is in no
way necessary for the security of Israel
and only diminishes the confidence of
the Arabs that a final outcome can be
freely and fairly negotiated.’’
President H.W. Bush, in 1990, said:
‘‘The foreign policy of the United
States says we do not believe there
should be new settlements in the West
Bank or in East Jerusalem.’’
President Clinton, in 2001, said that
‘‘the settlement enterprise and build-
ing bypass roads in the heart of what
they already know will one day be part
of a Palestinian state is inconsistent
with the Oslo commitment that both
sides negotiate a compromise.’’
President George W. Bush, in 2002,
said: ‘‘Israeli settlement activity in oc-
cupied territories must stop, and the
occupation must end through with-
drawal to secure and recognized bound-
aries.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S729
January 29, 2019
Finally, President Obama, in 2009,
said: ‘‘The United States does not ac-
cept the legitimacy of continued
Israeli settlements. This construction
violates previous agreements and un-
dermines efforts to achieve peace. It is
time for these settlements to stop.’’
So there you have a continuous line
of bipartisan Presidents, Republicans
and Democrats, expressing U.S. policy
on the issue of settlements. The provi-
sion before us today in this bill di-
rectly contradicts this long-stated U.S.
policy by drawing no distinction be-
tween someone boycotting businesses
located in the State of Israel and some-
one boycotting businesses located in
settlements in the territories. In other
words, the provision before us—and the
State laws it promotes—supports the
same penalty for those who boycott
commerce with a business in Tel Aviv
as it does those who boycott commerce
with businesses in the settlements, in-
cluding outposts that may be illegal
even under Israeli law. This provision
before us erases an important distinc-
tion in American policy that has been
endorsed by Presidents of both parties.
One of the reasons for discouraging
settlements and outposts in new areas
is to preserve the option of a two-state
solution—an option that has previously
been supported by Presidents of both
parties, as well as pro-Israel groups, in-
cluding AIPAC, J Street, and others. It
is a demographic reality that in order
to ensure a Jewish state that is demo-
cratic and provides equal rights to all
its citizens, there must be a two-state
solution.
Such a solution should come about
through a negotiated settlement be-
tween the parties—between the Israelis
and the Palestinians. We all know that
dysfunction and obstruction on the
Palestinian side has been one obstacle
to reaching an agreement, but that
does not justify changing the status
quo on the ground by adding settle-
ments in new areas that will make a
two-state solution impossible.
Second, the Trump administration,
under the guidance of the President’s
designated Middle East Senior Adviser,
his son-in-law Jared Kushner, has em-
barked on an undisguised effort to
crush the Palestinians by revoking all
U.S. humanitarian assistance. Here we
are, authorizing $38 billion for U.S.
military support for Israel—something
I strongly support and am a cosponsor
of—but at the same time, the Trump
administration has eliminated humani-
tarian and other assistance to help the
Palestinian people, many of whom are
living in horrible conditions. The
Trump administration has eliminated
assistance that helps provide medical
care, clean water, and food to hundreds
of thousands of vulnerable Palestinian
children and families. Much of this as-
sistance is provided by organizations
like Catholic Relief Services and the
Lutheran World Federation.
President Trump has also eliminated
$25 million in U.S. support to a net-
work of six hospitals in East Jeru-
salem, support the Congress explicitly
protected under the Taylor Force Act.
In doing this, he gutted funding for the
main hospitals providing cancer treat-
ment for patients in the West Bank and
Gaza and kidney dialysis for children.
These hospitals include Lutheran Au-
gusta Victoria Hospital, the Anglican
St. John of Jerusalem Eye Hospital,
and the Catholic St. Joseph Hospital—
American-founded institutions that
fall under our American Schools and
Hospitals Abroad Program.
The Trump administration has elimi-
nated support for those programs, but
the effort to crush the Palestinians
into submitting to a one-sided agree-
ment will never work. President Trump
and Jared Kushner apparently think
this is just another real estate deal
where you turn off the water and elec-
tricity to force your tenants out. In-
stead, these actions by the Trump ad-
ministration will only add fuel to the
boycott movement because many peo-
ple will see no other vehicle for ex-
pressing their views.
Finally, to the senior Senator from
Virginia and others supporting this
provision, nothing—nothing—will mo-
tivate Americans to exercise their
rights more than efforts to suppress
them. Trying to suppress free speech—
even unpopular speech, even conduct
we don’t support here and I don’t sup-
port—will only add momentum.
I will end where I started. It is a real-
ly shameful and disappointing day
when the sponsors of this legislation
took a bill demonstrating strong bipar-
tisan support for Israel, for our friends
and allies who share our commitment
to democracy and share other values
we hold dear—some Senators took that
bill and used it as an attack on the
constitutional rights of American citi-
zens who may want to peacefully dem-
onstrate their opposition to some of
the Netanyahu government’s policies,
not in the way the Presiding Officer
would choose, not in the way I would
choose, but in a way they have a right
to do as American citizens.
In making these changes to the bill,
the sponsors are sabotaging what was a
bipartisan bill to support our friend
and ally Israel and, in the process,
strengthening the very boycott move-
ment we seek to oppose. That hurts
Israel, that hurts the United States,
and it is a really sad day in the U.S.
Senate when we take something that
we have all agreed on and decide to use
it to attack the constitutional rights
of American citizens with whom we
may disagree. I am sorry it has come
to this point. I hope my colleagues will
think about this as we move forward in
this debate.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-

S. 1
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, yes-
terday afternoon, Senate Democrats fi-
nally dropped their filibuster of S. 1,
the Strengthening America’s Security
in the Middle East Act. It took 24 days
and 4 cloture votes, but enough of my
Democratic colleagues have now voted
to advance this legislation concerning
America’s role in the world.
As I mentioned before, the bill would
reaffirm our Nation’s commitment to
Israel’s security through military as-
sistance and cooperative missile de-
fense, as well as loan guarantees. It
would deepen our ties of strategic co-
operation with Jordan, as the security
and humanitarian ramifications of the
Syrian civil war continue to take their
toll, and the legislation also includes
the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection
Act, which would hold accountable
those who have enabled and carried out
the butchery of the Assad regime.
But I would like to take a few mo-
ments this morning to discuss an
amendment that I plan to propose as
well. The amendment I plan to propose
would expand on the legislation and
take a further step to emphasize the
need for American leadership in our
troubled world, particularly with re-
spect to our ongoing fight against al-
Qaida and ISIS in Syria and Afghani-
stan. My amendment would acknowl-
edge the plain fact that al-Qaida, ISIS,
and their affiliates in Syria and Af-
ghanistan continue to pose a serious
threat to us here at home. It would rec-
ognize the danger of a precipitous with-
drawal from either conflict and high-
light the need for diplomatic engage-
ment and political solutions to the un-
derlying conflicts in Syria and Afghan-
istan.
We have seen the costs of a precipi-
tous withdrawal before in Iraq, and in
Afghanistan, we have seen the
downsides of telling the enemy they
can just wait us out; we will be gone on
a date certain.
My amendment would also urge con-
tinued commitment from the U.S. mili-
tary and our partners until—until—we
have set the conditions for the endur-
ing defeat of these vile terrorists. This
measure would reflect the conclusions
of our Nation’s military and national
security professionals. It would speak
directly to our allies and reassure our
local partners who are doing the bulk
of the fighting against a shared enemy.
Simply put, while it is tempting to
retreat to the comfort and security of
our own shores, there is still a great
deal of work to be done, and we know
that left untended, these conflicts will
reverberate right here in our own cit-
ies.
We are not the world’s policemen,
but we are the leader of the free world,
and it is incumbent upon the United
States to lead, to continue to maintain
a global coalition against terror, and
to stand by our local partners who are

engaged in the daily fight against the
terrorists.
My amendment would further con-
demn Iran for its hampering of diplo-
matic efforts and its destabilizing work
throughout the region. It would call for
greater consultation with the United
States’ allies and partners in the re-
gion, especially Israel, with regard to
future stability we seek in a critical re-
gion, and it would reiterate the impor-
tance of the administration’s con-
sulting and coordinating with Congress
on its long-term strategies for success
in these struggles, including a thor-
ough accounting of the risk of with-
drawing too hastily.
I am glad that, after needless polit-
ical delays, our Democratic colleagues
finally allowed a first procedural vote
on this legislation.
I am proud to support its provisions
that concern Israel, Jordan, and Syria,
and I will be proud to offer this amend-
ment so the Senate can speak equally
clearly on the fight against al-Qaida,
ISIS, and other bad actors that needs
to continue in both Syria and Afghani-
stan.
H.R. 1
Mr. President, on a totally different
matter, this week Democrats in the
House are beginning the committee
process for a bill they are saying is
their party’s signature priority for this
Congress—their signature priority.
They are so focused on this legislation
that they have given it the ceremonial
designation of H.R. 1—their top pri-
ority.
I think it more accurately could be
described another way: the ‘‘Demo-
cratic Politician Protection Act.’’ This
sprawling proposal—sprawling, com-
prehensive proposal—is basically the
far left’s entire Christmas wish list
where our Nation’s political process is
concerned.
What would it do? It would pile new
Washington-focused regulations onto
virtually every aspect of how politi-
cians are elected and what Americans
can say about them.
My Democratic friends have already
tried to market this unprecedented in-
trusion with all the predictable cliches:
‘‘restoring democracy,’’ ‘‘for the peo-
ple.’’
Really? The only common motiva-
tion running through the whole pro-
posal seems to be this: Democrats
searching for ways to give Washington
politicians more control over what
Americans say about them and how
they get elected. It is an attempt to re-
write the rules of American politics in
order to benefit one side over the
other.
I expect I will be talking about the
‘‘Democratic Politician Protection
Act’’ here on the floor for a long time,
but I wanted to just take a few minutes
today to give my colleagues a quick
tour—just a quick tour through a few
of its components.
To begin with, Democrats want to
make the Federal Elections Commis-
sion a partisan institution. Since Wa-
tergate, the FEC has been a six-mem-
ber body. Neither party gets more than
three seats—neither party. After all,
the reason for that is this is a Commis-
sion with the sensitive duty of regu-
lating Americans’ speech—Americans’
speech about politics and campaigns
themselves.
The FEC should not be a weapon that
one political party can wield against
its rivals, but the legislation the
Democrats are moving through com-
mittee would throw away—throw
away—the bipartisan split. It would re-
duce the FEC to a five-member body
and—listen to this—let sitting Presi-
dents pick the majority—let sitting
Presidents pick the majority. Obvi-
ously, this is a recipe for turning the
FEC into a partisan weapon.
Democrats also empower the newly
partisan FEC to regulate more of what
Americans can say. That 3-to-2 FEC
would get to determine what they sub-
jectively see as ‘‘campaign related,’’ a
new vague category of regulated
speech.
There would also be new latitude to
decide when a nonprofit’s speech has
crossed that same fuzzy line and subse-
quently force the publication of the
group’s private supporters.
All of this appears to be custom built
to chill the exercise of the First
Amendment and give Federal bureau-
crats and the waiting leftwing mob a
clearer idea of just whom to intimi-
date.
And this just scratches the surface of
this proposal. The House Democrats
are also eyeing an expensive new set of
taxpayer subsidies for political cam-
paign consultants. They want a new
six-fold government match for certain
types of political contributions—a new
federally funded voucher program to
line politicians’ pockets with even
more taxpayer dollars, plus—listen to
this. That wasn’t enough—taking our
tax money to spend on attack ads and
bumper strips and the like. Listen to
this: 6 additional days of paid vacation
for any Federal bureaucrat who decides
they would like to hover around a poll-
ing place while Americans cast ballots.
So the new taxpayer subsidies don’t
even pass the laugh test, but other as-
pects of the bill are even more dis-
turbing. Perhaps most worrisome of all
is the unprecedented proposal to fed-
eralize our elections, giving Wash-
ington politicians even more control
over who gets to come here in the first
place.
Hundreds—literally hundreds—of
pages are dedicated to telling States
how to run their elections, from when
and where they must take place to the
procedures they have to follow, to the
machines they have to use.
Democrats want to import the ineffi-
ciencies of State and Federal bureauc-
racy to ballot boxes and voter rolls,
while making it harder for States and
localities to clean inaccurate data off
the voter rolls, harder to remove dupli-
cate registrations, ineligible voters,
and errors, and harder to check every
box Washington Democrats demand be-
fore allowing you to pick your rep-
resentatives.
Provision after provision would make
it easier for campaign lawyers to take
advantage of disorganization, chaos,
and confusion. Yet the proposal does
practically nothing to combat the real
live voter fraud that does happen right
before our eyes.
It is suspiciously silent on the murky
‘‘ballot harvesting’’ practices that re-
cently threw North Carolina’s Ninth
Congressional District into total chaos.
There are pages and pages rewriting
election law but nothing on this actual
problem, perhaps because similar prac-
tices are perfectly legal in California—
perfectly legal—where the Democratic
Party made big gains in the House just
last November.
So like I said, this has just been an
introductory tour I am giving this
morning—just an introductory tour.
This sprawling power grab clocks in at
570 pages—570 pages. Seemingly every
one of these pages is filled with some
effort to rewrite the rules to favor the
Democrats and their friends.
I have to say this: Our colleagues
across the Capitol know what they are
after. So I am going to continue to
shed light on these far-left proposals
many mornings. I want to make sure
the American people understand what
this is all about. I want to assure the
American people, right from the out-
set, that my colleagues and I will fight
to prevent this one-sided power grab. It
may pass the House, but not the Sen-
ate.

RESOLUTION OF DISAPPROVAL ON RUSSIA
SANCTIONS
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, a
vote earlier this month on the adminis-
tration’s decision to ease sanctions on
a Russian oligarch puts the Senate on
record on where its Members stand in
terms of holding Russia accountable
for its continued actions against the
United States.
We need to be clear about what we
are facing. Not only did Russia conduct
what I believe to be a cyber act of war
against the United States during the
2016 election cycle, it continues to do
so with the President and his adminis-
tration, apparently, indifferent.
Make no mistake. Russia tried to
interfere in the recent midterm elec-
tions, and it continues to do so against
our democratic allies in Europe. What
has been the response of this body—the
U.S. Senate—sworn to uphold the Con-
stitution, to protect against enemies,
foreign and domestic? Other than the
belated passage of a Russia sanctions
bill in the last Congress—a bill whose
sanction provisions this administration
has been slow or unwilling to enforce—
we have done almost nothing.
Let’s start in 2016 when top officials
from the administration’s national se-
curity and intelligence community
came and warned congressional leader-
ship of Russia’s ongoing and serious at-
tack on our election—this was during
the election campaign—rightly asking
for a bipartisan statement to tell Rus-
sian dictator Putin to stop.
What was Senate Majority Leader
MCCONNELL’s response to this request
to protect our Nation?
No thanks; not going to do it.
History will no doubt look back with
amazement at that decision.
What about the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee—a historically cele-
brated body with jurisdiction over this
Russian attack on the United States?
It did not even conduct an investiga-
tion into Russia’s actions in the last
Congress. To date, I have heard no
plans to do so in this Congress. That is
incredible.
We have stunning reports—reports
that normally would bring this city to
a halt—of an FBI counterintelligence
investigation opened on President
Trump—whether the President called
for the destruction of notes after meet-
ings with Russian leaders . . . some-
thing unheard of in the history of that
office . . . and that Trump has been
asking about how the United States
could possibly withdraw from the
NATO alliance.
These are stunning developments,
and they are not alone. For anyone
paying attention, they shouldn’t be
surprised that our President is, in fact,
pursuing policies the Russians could
only dream of. They include the weak-
ening of our democratic institutions;
the weakening of our Western security
alliance; the withdrawing of U.S. lead-
ership on the global stage and ceding
influence to Russia, Iran, and China; si-
lence when Russia attacked Ukrainian
naval ships; entertaining the idea of
turning over an American ambassador
to Russia for an absurd line of ques-
tioning; cozying up to global dictators
and ignoring American values of de-
mocracy of human rights; and, of
course, the President saying publicly
and privately to Putin that he believes
him instead of our intelligence experts
when it comes to denying any attacks
on democracy.
We also know that President Trump
was incredibly suggesting such Russia-
friendly policies during his campaign
while at the same time pursuing busi-
ness interests in that country.
I end with a question I have asked be-
fore on this floor. How can the party of
Ronald Reagan continue to sit by while
this President pursues policies aligned
with a former KGB agent? Why are the
first bills in this new Senate under Re-
publican control not dealing with the
serious threats to our Nation? Why
isn’t the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee holding urgent hearings on
these stunning developments between
an American President and a Russian
dictator, not to mention moving bipar-
tisan legislation to protect U.S. mem-
bership in NATO?
Quite simply, with the government
finally back open we need deal with
these serious threats to our nation and
democracy that we have heard involv-
ing our White House. When we are
elected to office in Congress, we take
an oath. In it, we swear to uphold and
defend the Constitution of the United
States against all enemies, foreign and
domestic. The President similarly
swears to preserve, protect, and defend
our Constitution. As such, it is time
for all of us—Democrats and Repub-
licans—to speak up and fulfill our con-
stitutional responsibility.
FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES
Madam President, for anyone who
thought the upheaval in the for-profit
college industry was over or it was
driven by an overzealous Obama ad-
ministration determined to kill the in-
dustry, as some accused just a few
short months ago, it is time to think
again.
Just last month, amid the loving reg-
ulatory embrace of the for-profit col-
lege industry by President Trump’s
DeVos-led Department of Education,
two major for-profit college chains
have collapsed. It proves true the re-
cent warning by the Department of
Education inspector general, Kathleen
Tighe, that for-profit colleges rep-
resent a disproportionate risk to both
students and American taxpayers.
The rot in the for-profit college in-
dustry runs much deeper than just the
failures of Corinthian and ITT Tech.
On December 17, for-profit college com-
pany Vatterott Colleges announced the
immediate closure of its campuses na-
tionwide, leaving 2,300 students strand-
ed, including 200 at its campus in Fair-
view Heights, IL. The company had
been in financial trouble for some
time. It had already closed a number of
campuses, including one in Quincy, IL.
The Department of Education must
now provide Illinois and other
Vatterott students with clear informa-
tion about their options, including
their eligibility to receive a closed
school discharge of their Federal stu-
dent loans and option to file a claim
for a borrower defense discharge if they
believe they were defrauded by the uni-
versity.
In addition, the Department must
make sure these students are not put
at risk a second time by assuring that
they have affordable, quality options
to continue their education, such as
community colleges. It would be add-
ing insult to injury to allow these stu-
dents to be lured by other predatory or
financially shaky for-profit colleges,
especially those facing State and Fed-
eral investigations.
Early in December, Education Cor-
poration of America closed 75 campuses
nationwide, affecting some 20,000 stu-
dents. I am pleased, in this case, that
the Department of Education devel-
oped a page on its website to inform
ECA students about closed school dis-
charges. It must do more to commu-
nicate with affected students and en-
sure they are able to continue their
studies at quality, affordable institu-
tions.
The vultures are already circling
these students.
In a recent letter, Steve Gunderson, a
former Member of the U.S. House of
Representatives and lead lobbyist for
the for-profit colleges and universities,
announced that for-profit colleges are
working to assist the students who
were victims of these collapsed for-
profit schools and that 20 for-profit col-
leges had already expressed interest in
taking on these ECA students. It is
simply double jeopardy to ask stu-
dents, once defrauded by this industry,
to be somehow rescued and lured into
another contractual obligation by an-
other school in the for-profit college
industry.
Over the holiday season, around 30
campuses owned by Dream Center Edu-
cation Holdings closed. They include
the Argosy campus in Schaumburg, IL,
and the Illinois Institute of Art—not to
be confused with the School of the Art
Institute of Chicago, a reputable orga-
nization.
In August, I led several of my col-
leagues in writing to Secretary DeVos,

asking her to provide immediate as-
sistance to these students who had bor-
rowed money to go to these worthless
schools. We were concerned that Dream
Center was not providing students with
information about closed school dis-
charges and was pushing them into
other bad options, like enrolling in an-
other for-profit school. Among other
things, we asked the Department to
post an information page on its website
to inform the students. Even weeks
after the closure, we have yet to re-
ceive a response to this letter from the
Department of Education.
Adding to the confusion for students
in Illinois is the fact that for months
Dream Center misrepresented that the
Illinois Institute of Art campuses were
accredited, even when its accreditor
had made clear that was not the case.
I have called on Secretary DeVos to in-
vestigate this misrepresentation, espe-
cially as it relates to these students’
eligibility for borrower defense dis-
charges. The National Student Loan
Defense Network has filed a class ac-
tion lawsuit on behalf of Illinois bor-
rowers against the company for this
misrepresentation, while the Depart-
ment of Education and Washington re-
main silent.
Now, reports have surfaced of a new
restructuring of these schools, with few
details but major implications for stu-
dents. The Department of Education
must immediately inform students and
the public about these changes.
Earlier this month, 48 State attor-
neys general, including our own Illinois
attorney general, now retired, Lisa
Madigan, and the District of Columbia
reached a settlement with for-profit
giant Career Education Corporation
over consumer violations by the com-
pany. Under the settlement, Career
Education Corporation agreed to forgo
collecting $493 million owed to it by
180,000 students nationally—$48 million
in relief for 17,000 students in Illinois
who had been exploited by this for-
profit school. I have long spoken out
about these abuses and the misconduct
of Career Education Corporation
schools, especially their infamous and
now defunct Le Cordon Bleu, Har-
rington College of Design, and Sanford-
Brown brands. These fellows really
dream up some wonderful names for
worthless schools.
Just last week, for-profit college op-
erator National American University
Holdings announced ‘‘substantial
doubt’’ that its finances would allow it
to remain in business over the next
year. The company, which has faced
lawsuits related to deceptive practices,
runs campuses in about a dozen States
and online. Its closure would affect
thousands of students.
How many more for-profit college
collapses, closures, and State legal ac-
tions will it take before we get serious
at the Federal level, both in Congress
and at the Department of Education,
about protecting students and tax-
payers from this industry?
It just amazes me that so many peo-
ple in this body stand back and watch
the so-called for-profit colleges and
universities exploit students and their
families, watch them run up debts they
will never be able to pay back, wait
until they default, and then threaten
them with lawsuits and collection
agencies, instead of realizing at the
outset that these schools are not rep-
utable. These students are lured with
promises the schools can’t keep, and
they are also lured into debt they will
never be able to repay. They will never
end up with a job that allows them to
pay back the debt.
Don’t take my word for it; think of
two simple numbers. Nine percent of
all postsecondary students go to for-
profit colleges and universities—9 per-
cent. Thirty-four percent of all federal
student loan defaults are students from
for-profit colleges and universities.
Nine percent of the students; 34 percent
of the defaults. Why would that be hap-
pening? Well, because they overcharge
the students, and they provide them
with a worthless diploma if they stick
it out and don’t drop out.
These schools are a blight on higher
education and an exploitation of inno-
cent students and their families. Who
are the ultimate losers when their
debts are discharged? American tax-
payers who subsidize these miserable,
good-for-nothing schools and then
watch as they are not repaying their
debts because the students can’t, and
the taxpayers end up the losers again.
If that is capitalism at work, save this
country, because it is a terrible out-
come for the students, for their fami-
lies, and for American taxpayers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S733
January 29, 2019
SEC. lll. SENSE OF SENATE ON WITHDRAWALS
OF UNITED STATES FORCES FROM
SYRIA AND AFGHANISTAN.
(a) FINDINGS.—The Senate makes the fol-
lowing findings:
(1) The foreign terrorist organization al
Qaeda, responsible for the attacks of Sep-
tember 11, 2001, maintains a presence in Af-
ghanistan.
(2) The Islamic State of Iraq and al Sham,
better known by its acronym ISIS, flour-
ished in the chaos unleashed by the civil war
in Syria and at one point controlled exten-
sive territory in Iraq and Syria.
(3) Al Qaeda, ISIS, and their affiliates have
murdered thousands of innocent civilians.
(4) Al Qaeda, ISIS, and their affiliates have
proven resilient and have regrouped when
the United States and its partners have
withdrawn from the fight against them.
(b) SENSE OF SENATE.—The Senate—
(1) acknowledges that the United States
military and our partners have made signifi-
cant progress in the campaign against al
Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and al
Sham (ISIS), and honors the contributions
and sacrifice of the members of the United
States Armed Forces who have served on the
front lines of this fight;
(2) recognizes the continuing threat to the
homeland and our allies posed by al Qaeda
and ISIS, which maintain an ability to oper-
ate in Syria and Afghanistan;
(3) expresses concern that Iran has sup-
ported the Taliban in Afghanistan and
Hizballah and the Assad regime in Syria, and
has sought to frustrate diplomatic efforts to
resolve conflicts in these two countries;
(4) recognizes the positive role the United
States and its partners have played in Syria
and Afghanistan fighting terrorist groups,
countering Iranian aggression, deterring the
further use of chemical weapons, and pro-
tecting human rights;
(5) warns that a precipitous withdrawal of
United States forces from the on-going fight
against these groups, without effective,
countervailing efforts to secure gains in
Syria and Afghanistan, could allow terror-
ists to regroup, destabilize critical regions,
and create vacuums that could be filled by
Iran or Russia, to the detriment of United
States interests and those of our allies;
(6) recognizes that al Qaeda and ISIS pose
a global threat, which merits increased
international contributions to the counter-
terrorism, diplomatic, and stabilization ef-
forts underway in Syria and Afghanistan;
(7) recognizes that diplomatic efforts to se-
cure peaceful, negotiated solutions to the
conflicts in Syria and Afghanistan are nec-
essary to long-term stability and counterter-
rorism efforts in the Middle East and South
Asia;
(8) acknowledges the progress made by
Special Representative Khalilzad in his ef-
forts to promote reconciliation in Afghani-
stan;
(9) calls upon the Administration to con-
duct a thorough review of the military and
diplomatic strategies in Syria and Afghani-
stan, including an assessment of the risk
that withdrawal from those countries could
strengthen the power and influence of Russia
and Iran in the Middle East and South Asia
and undermine diplomatic efforts toward ne-
gotiated, peaceful solutions;
(10) requests that the Administration, as
part of this review, solicit the views of
Israel, our regional partners, and other key
troop-contributing nations in the fight
against al Qaeda and ISIS;
(11) reiterates support for international
diplomatic efforts to facilitate peaceful, ne-
gotiated resolutions to the on-going conflicts
in Syria and Afghanistan on terms that re-
spect the rights of innocent civilians and
deny safe havens to terrorists;
(12) calls upon the Administration to pur-
sue a strategy that sets the conditions for
the long-term defeat of al Qaeda and ISIS, as
well as the protection of regional partners
and allies, while ensuring that Iran cannot
dominate the region or threaten Israel;
(13) encourages close collaboration be-
tween the Executive Branch and the Legisla-
tive Branch to ensure continuing strong, bi-
partisan support for United States military
operations in Syria and Afghanistan; and
(14) calls upon the Administration to cer-
tify that conditions have been met for the
enduring defeat of al Qaeda and ISIS before
initiating any significant withdrawal of
United States forces from Syria or Afghani-
stan.

ator from Texas.
HOUSTON SHOOTING
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I
would like to start by saying a few
words about the horrific shooting that
occurred in Houston, TX, at about 5
o’clock yesterday.
A team of narcotics patrol officers
from the Houston Police Department
were serving a warrant. As soon as
they breached the door at the home in
southeast Houston, the suspects opened
fire. Four officers were hit; one criti-
cally, and one other was injured as a
result of an unrelated mishap. Three of
these officers were in good condition,
and two remained in critical but stable
condition in the hospital.
For the case agent, the most senior
officer on the narcotics squad, this was
the third time he had been shot in the
line of duty—once in 1992 and again in
1997. He told Chief Art Acevedo: ‘‘I had
to get in there because I knew my guys
were down.’’
I echo the Houston Police Union
President Joe Gamaldi, who said last
night that enough is enough. This type
of attack against law enforcement is
unconscionable and unacceptable.
These are dedicated public servants
who have taken an oath to serve and
protect our communities and who po-
tentially sacrifice their very lives
every day to keep our families safe.
Today, with a heavy heart, I want to
thank the Houston Police Department
and law enforcement officers across the
country who put on the uniform each
morning, never knowing what the day
might bring. We are incredibly grateful
for their service and the tremendous
sacrifices they make.
I also want to acknowledge the work
of the Houston Fire and EMS Depart-
ment who moved Heaven and Earth to
ensure these heroic, wounded officers
got the medical care they needed as
soon as possible.
I thank my friends Houston Mayor
Sylvester Turner and Chief Acevedo for
their leadership during this very dif-
ficult time for the city of Houston and
our entire State.
My wife Sandy and I are praying for
the officers, their families, and their
brothers and sisters in blue.
S. 1
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, the Senate is, of course, consid-
ering S. 1, a package of four bills that
were considered in the 115th Congress,
but the clock ran out before these bills
could be voted on, on the Senate floor.
Each of these bills enjoys broad, bi-
partisan support, and I am glad we
have the opportunity to push this leg-
islation over the finish line this week.
The administration recently an-
nounced that U.S. troops will begin a
conditions-based withdrawal from
Syria. While we await additional de-
tails on the timeline and extent of this
move, we must take action to ensure
the stability of the region during the
process and reassure our allies of our
commitment.
My friend and colleague Senator
RUBIO, the lead sponsor of this bill,
once compared the threat of ISIS to a
tumor. He said: If you treat a tumor
with radiation, it will get smaller and
smaller and smaller, but if you stop be-
fore it is completely gone, it will come
back. So it is with ISIS.
First and foremost, the Strength-
ening America’s Security in the Middle
East Act supports our allies in the re-
gion, including Israel and Jordan. With
Israel in particular, the bill authorizes
the United States to provide military
assistance to support funding coopera-
tive programs to develop, produce, and
procure essential military equipment,
such as defensive missiles and rockets.
This will help Israel maintain its quali-
tative military edge against increas-
ingly well-equipped, Iranian-backed
forces.
This bill also provides U.S. State and
local governments with greater flexi-
bility to counter the boycott, divest-
ment, and sanctions, or BDS, move-
ment. This anti-Israel crusade has
waged economic war against the Jew-
ish State by pushing companies around
the world to boycott any business with
Israel or its entities.
This does not outlaw BDS activity
but instead provides State and local
governments with the same flexibility
afforded to private companies. They
can decide not to do business with com-
panies that are boycotting or divesting
from Israel.
To support our ally Jordan, this bill
authorizes legislation to strengthen
our defense cooperation. With an esti-
mated 740,000 refugees in Jordan—a
very small country—this legislation
recognizes the immense impact the on-
going conflict in Syria continues to
have on neighboring countries, includ-
ing Jordan, and it supports that gov-
ernment’s effort to provide ongoing hu-
manitarian support.
The final piece of the bill speaks to
the ongoing conflict and humanitarian
crisis in Syria, which has claimed the
lives of some 400,000 people—400,000
people. It provides aid to impacted
communities and condemns the hei-
nous human rights violations com-
mitted by the Assad regime. Notably,
it imposes new sanctions on anyone
who does business with or otherwise fi-
nancially supports the Syrian regime.
This is certainly not an effort to put
Humpty Dumpty back together again.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S734 January 29, 2019
Unfortunately, Syria has been broken
by the civil war and the fact that Iran,
Russia, and terrorist organizations are
all vying for space and influence, but it
is an important step to protect U.S. in-
terests in the region. That is what this
bill represents.
Notably absent are strong measures
focused on addressing the region’s pri-
mary antagonist, the nation of Iran—
the world’s leading state sponsor of
terrorism.
Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard
Corps, or IRGC, is a branch of Iran’s
Armed Forces with an unconventional
role. Unlike military operations that
promote national security, the IRGC
tries to squash democracy movements
both at home and abroad by pushing its
extreme ideology beyond Iran’s bor-
ders. This branch wields vast power
and influence, and it uses its capabili-
ties to spark turmoil throughout the
Middle East.
What I find particularly concerning
is that the IRGC, the primary military
appendage of the Ayatollah, is the one
in control of Iran’s ballistic missile
system. That is the same program
which, unfortunately, only accelerated
under the previous Presidential admin-
istration of President Obama.
The primary enemy of the IRGC is
Israel, which it threatens both directly
through its land bridge across Iraq and
Syria and indirectly through its sup-
port of terrorist groups, such as Leba-
nese Hezbollah, Hamas, and other Pal-
estinian militant groups. The IRGC
funds terrorist proxies by providing
heavy weapons, training, and funds to
advance the Iranian regime’s goal of
regional domination. It has helped
Hezbollah alone to amass more than
100,000 missiles capable of striking vir-
tually anywhere in the State of Israel.
The financial machines that keep
these operations afloat consist of a
clandestine network of front compa-
nies, including energy, construction,
telecommunications, banking, and fi-
nancial sectors. We are not talking
about just a handful of small busi-
nesses here. It is estimated that the
IRGC alone controls one-quarter of
Iran’s economy.
So, yes, this legislation does take im-
portant steps to promote U.S. interests
in the Middle East, but actions against
the IRGC are desperately needed.
In addition to the threat already
posed by this group, we cannot allow
our withdrawal from Syria to open up
the window to Iran and its terrorist
proxies. Today, I am offering an
amendment to this legislation that will
address the actions of the IRGC. This
amendment enjoyed bipartisan support
last Congress with 8 bipartisan cospon-
sors in the Senate and more than 220
cosponsors in the House. This amend-
ment is entitled the Iranian Revolu-
tionary Guard Corps Economic Exclu-
sion Act, and it will take steps to in-
crease economic pressure on the ag-
gressive actions taken by Iran and exe-
cuted by the IRGC.
The bill will impose additional sanc-
tions on the IRGC by lowering the
threshold to sanction entities sup-
porting these activities. That means
the front companies that are
bankrolling the IRGC’s attacks against
our allies can now be sanctioned, effec-
tively cutting off their cash flow. In
addition, it penalizes any other person
or company that supports the IRGC, in-
cluding a complete ban on transactions
with U.S. businesses or individuals.
Of course, in order to sanction any
entity, we first have to know that they
are associated with the IRGC. This bill
would require that entities for which
there is a reasonable basis to believe
IRGC owns at least 33 percent be re-
ported and included. It also requires a
report analyzing foreign and domestic
supply chains that in some way sup-
port or aid the IRGC and its activities.
I hope my colleagues will support
this amendment, which takes a strong
stand against Iran, the No. 1 state
sponsor of terrorism, and its military
arm, the IRGC. This group has sup-
ported the genocidal Assad regime and
has the blood of countless innocent ci-
vilians on its hands.

ator from Rhode Island.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I am very happy to be joined by

Senator HASSAN. I ask unanimous con-

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, we are here to talk about the
risks to our New England coastal com-
munities from the climate changes
coming our way.
Despite the really dirty efforts of the
fossil fuel industry to keep the truth at
bay, the tide of public understanding is
turning. A recent survey by Yale and
George Mason Universities found that
73 percent of Americans now see global
warming happening. That number is up
10 percentage points since 2015. Simi-
larly, the percentage of Americans who
consider global warming an important
issue rose from 63 percent to 72 percent
in the past 10 years. In just the past
year, the number of Americans who say
they are worried about global warming
jumped from 61 to 69 percent. One au-
thor of this research explained the re-
sults to the New York Times this way:
People are beginning to understand that
climate change is here in the United States,
here in my state, in my community, affect-
ing the people and places I care about, and
now. This isn’t happening in 50 years, 100
years from now.
Dr. Katharine Hayhoe of Texas Tech
University echoed these sentiments,
saying: ‘‘Today, nearly everyone can
point to a way that they are personally
witnessing and are being personally af-
fected by the impacts of a changing cli-
mate in the places where they live.’’
Perhaps nowhere is this more true
than along our coasts, where manmade
climate change is already flooding
towns, driving fisheries away from tra-
ditional fishing grounds, and bringing
ashore stronger storms riding on high-
er seas.
Last Tuesday, I picked up my home
State paper, the Providence Journal,
and I saw this headline splashed across
the front page regarding climate
change: ‘‘Washed Away. . . . Home val-
ues lost to rising sea levels.’’
This is a study I have mentioned be-
fore. It was done by the First Street
Foundation and researchers at Colum-
bia University and looks at what esca-
lating flood risk is doing to coastal
housing markets. That study started in
Florida—peer-reviewed work in Flor-
ida—and they took that methodology
and have been working their way up
the gulf coast and the New England
coast since then. They just reached my
State and Senator HASSAN’s State, and
the report is not pleasant. They found
that Massachusetts, Maine, New Hamp-
shire, and Rhode Island lost a total of
$403 million in expected property value
between 2005 and 2017 due to increased
tidal flooding risks. Just between 2005
and 2017, Rhode Island coastal prop-
erties lost nearly $45 million in ex-
pected value. The study called out
these particular properties in Warren,
RI, that lost over one-third of their
value during that timeframe. Rhode Is-
landers in the town of Warwick lost
over $4 million in home values due to
the threat of climate change-driven sea
level rise.
Several studies warned how climate
change will affect coastal property val-
ues. The First Street Foundation study
is the first to demonstrate value loss
that has already occurred, as the study
itself says. A Columbia University re-
searcher who worked on the First
Street study said this:
Each time we analyze a new state we see
the same phenomenon. Increased tidal flood-
ing leads to a loss in home value apprecia-
tion. As sea level rise accelerates, we expect
the corresponding loss in relative home
value to accelerate as well.
That hits home indeed. The latest
scientific evidence shows sea levels ris-
ing at a faster pace than expected.
NOAA data shows that Greenland lost
around 280 billion tons of ice per year
from 2002 to 2016. A National Geo-
graphic article covering this study
noted: ‘‘The Greenland ice sheet is
10,000 feet thick in places and contains
enough ice to raise sea levels 23 feet.’’
Another study shows that the Ant-
arctic ice sheet has lost around 252 bil-
lion tons of ice per year over the last 10
years. Again, according to National Ge-
ographic, full melting of the Antarctic
ice sheet could mean nearly 187 feet of
sea level rise.
In Rhode Island, our Coastal Re-
sources Management Council has been
a longtime leader in modeling flooding
and sea level rise risks for Rhode Is-
land’s coastal businesses, communities,
and decision makers. Earlier this
month, CRMC partnered with the Uni-
versity of Rhode Island to release a se-
ries of highly detailed risk maps for
several coastal Rhode Island towns.

January 29, 2019
These maps provide a damage assess-
ment for individual structures due to
flooding and storm waves for homes
and businesses and critical infrastruc-
ture, like the Warren wastewater treat-
ment plant, which is right there on the
coast of Warren, RI; the facility will be
almost totally wiped out. CRMC’s maps
turn these general risks facing our
communities from a hazy sketch to a
vivid, living-color, 3–D picture, and
that picture is grim for these coastal
communities.
Rhode Island officials are currently
preparing for a worst case scenario of
more than 9 feet of sea level rise over-
taking our 400 miles of coastline by the
end of the century. This map is from
Rhode Island’s CRMC’s interactive
STORMTOOLS application, which
overlays the sea level rise projections
over our current topography. The blue
all through here is currently land that
is flooded when 10 feet of sea level rise
come. This extra little rim of green on
some of the edges is when you push it
up to 12 feet. As we see all of the blue
here, think of homes and businesses
and properties that are owned by peo-
ple and that are going to literally dis-
appear into the ocean if we don’t pay
attention. These are the homes and
businesses of my constituents.
A 2017 report from the real estate
database company Zillow identified
over 4,800 homes in Rhode Island, val-
ued at near $3 billion, that would be
underwater by 2100, using an optimistic
estimate of only 6 feet of sea level rise.
In this snapshot from Upper Narra-
gansett Bay, you can see some of
Rhode Island’s larger coastal commu-
nities stranded as a scattered series of
new islands, a Rhode Island archi-
pelago. Today’s map of Rhode Island—
the map that we have known since our
founding—will become unrecognizable
as Warwick Neck here breaks off to be-
come its own island, Newport south of
this map splits, and Bristol through
here comes apart.
A recent report from Climate Central
and Zillow looked at new homes being
built in risky coastal areas—ones ex-
pected to suffer from annual floods by
2050 under a moderate greenhouse gas
emissions model—and they show Rhode
Island has seen more growth in risk
areas than in safe areas. Obviously, if
emissions don’t meet these moderate
goals, things are going to get a good
deal worse, and well before water actu-
ally overtakes your home, well before
the water is coming through the front
door will come the economic effects of
rising oceans, and they will be big.
In 2017, GAO reported that coastal
areas face particularly high financial
risks and that annual coastal property
losses from sea level rise and increased
storms will run into the billions of dol-
lars every year in the short run and
over $50 billion every year by late cen-
tury. EPA has estimated ‘‘$5.0 trillion
in economic costs to coastal property
from climate change through 2100’’—$5
trillion, and that is the Rhode Island
part of that. The Union of Concerned
Scientists reports that sea level rise
will double the number of coastal com-
munities facing what they call ‘‘chron-
ic inundation and possible retreat’’—
meaning you are out of there—by 2035.
The market is awakening to these
risks. Moody’s evaluates municipal
bonds. It has begun evaluating the
bonds of coastal communities with an
eye to this flooding risk. Banks, mort-
gagors, insurance companies, and ap-
praisers are starting to incorporate
these risks into their work for coastal
properties.
A recent issue of the Appraisal Insti-
tute’s Valuation magazine quoted
Rhode Island appraiser Brad Hevenor,
warning that homes that receive a 30-
year mortgage this year ‘‘might be
completely different types of property
[by the end of their mortgage] than
they are today.’’ Good luck getting a
30-year mortgage on a property that
the bank believes will be ‘‘completely
different’’ by the end of the mortgage.
The coastal housing market is on the
precipice of a dangerous financial cliff.
First Street, Zillow, NOAA, GAO, EPA,
Climate Central, the Union of Con-
cerned Scientists, and others all make
the same warning.
Federal home mortgage giant
Freddie Mac said it this way: ‘‘The eco-
nomic losses and social disruption may
happen gradually, but they are likely
to be greater in total than those expe-
rienced in the housing crisis and Great
Recession.’’
The editor of the insurance industry
trade publication Risk & Insurance
said this: ‘‘Continually rising seas will
damage coastal residential and com-
mercial property values to the point
that property owners will flee those
markets in droves, thus precipitating a
mortgage value collapse that could
equal or exceed the mortgage crisis
that rocked the global economy in
2008.’’
These are serious warnings, and they
are deadly serious warnings for our
coastal States. Here in Congress, these
warnings fall on deaf ears—ears
plugged deaf by the fossil fuel indus-
try’s persistent mischief.
We have to get serious about our
duty to our constituents. Polling shows
that millions of Americans want us to
face up to this threat, to safeguard
their coastal property, and to curb the
carbon pollution that is distorting our
Earth’s climate and raising our Earth’s
oceans. It is seriously time for us to
wake up.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire.
Ms. HASSAN. Madam President, I
want to start by thanking my col-
league, Senator WHITEHOUSE from
Rhode Island, not only for his remarks
today but for his leadership on this
issue. I rise today to join him in high-
lighting the toll climate change is tak-
ing on coastal communities throughout
New England. Senator WHITEHOUSE has
been a fierce advocate, and he is dedi-
cated to and continues to push our col-
leagues to address the dire reality of
climate change. I am here to join him
in that effort.
In New Hampshire’s Seacoast region,
our State’s beautiful coastline helps
propel our economy forward, sup-
porting industries such as tourism and
commercial fishing and contributing to
our high quality of life. Just as prox-
imity to the ocean provides vital op-
portunities, our communities are find-
ing that as climate change intensifies,
these communities are increasingly at
risk.
As you can see from this photo that
was taken last year in Rye, NH, strong-
er storms and rising sea levels are lead-
ing to increased flooding in our coastal
areas. As Senator WHITEHOUSE men-
tioned, our communities are already
feeling the direct economic impacts of
rising sea levels.
According to the First Street Foun-
dation and Columbia University, the
increased risk of flooding and damage
is hurting property values throughout
New England. That report states that
New Hampshire has already seen a $15
million loss in property value, particu-
larly in areas such as Hampton, Exeter,
Dover, and Portsmouth. Combined with
the rest of the New England States,
coastal properties have experienced ap-
proximately $400 million in property
value losses just between 2005 and 2017.
The extent of those losses is just the
beginning of the damage. The National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Association
has estimated that New Hampshire’s
sea levels are expected to rise between
0.6 and 2 feet by 2050 and between 1.6
and 6.6 feet by 2100. According to the
Union of Concerned Scientists, rising
seas could threaten more than 5,000
homes on the seacoast of New Hamp-
shire by the end of the century.
Our climate is changing. Sea levels
are rising. This is undebatable. Climate
change and sea level rise are not
threats to some distant time in the fu-
ture; these threats—this damage—are
here. These threats are taking their
toll now. The people of New Hampshire
know this. We are witnessing climate
change in our communities in real time
as storms get more intense and the
floodwaters go higher.
It is our responsibility to help our
communities adapt to these changes.
This starts with focusing on planning
for resiliency to help vulnerable com-
munities prepare and on improving our
infrastructure and developing strate-
gies to help plan ahead for storms and
extreme weather events.
At the local level, Granite Staters on
the seacoast are already being
proactive on this front. Community
members have formed advocacy groups,
and local governments have focused on
addressing these challenges head-on
and developing resilient strategies. We
have to support their efforts.
We also must do more. We need to re-
double efforts to cut carbon emissions,
conserve and protect our natural re-
sources, and build a stronger, clean en-
ergy future. People are calling on us to

act. Study after study has shown that
as more Americans see the direct
threats from climate change in their
own communities and in the lives of
their fellow citizens, they are becom-
ing increasingly worried. It is time for
us to start dealing with reality and to
address their concerns.
I will keep working to address cli-
mate change and to achieve a cleaner
environment and stronger energy fu-
ture that will help our citizens, our
economy, and our businesses thrive. I
urge my colleagues to join us in those
efforts.
Again, I thank Senator WHITEHOUSE
for being a leader in those efforts.
Madam President, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CAS-
SIDY). The Senator from Tennessee.
TRIBUTE TO CHARLIE DANIEL
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President,
late in December, I announced that I
would not be a candidate for reelection
to the U.S. Senate in 2020, and that
prompted this cartoon in the Knoxville
News Sentinel by Charlie Daniel:
He says his name is Alexander. He says he
is going to walk across the State. Wonder
how far he will go.
Here is some character wandering
across the State in a red and black
shirt, which is what I did 40 years ago
when I walked across the State run-
ning for Governor.
I would like to return the favor to
Charlie Daniel because he announced
last week that he is retiring from
drawing cartoons in the Knoxville
News Sentinel, which is a much more
significant event than anything I
might do because Charlie Daniel has
been a fixture in Tennessee for a long
time with his gentle skewering of poli-
ticians in the Knoxville newspapers.
Charlie’s cartoons have been the first
things I have looked for in the Knox-
ville newspapers since the year I grad-
uated from Maryville High School in
1958. That is when Charlie first began
drawing for the Knoxville Journal.
Charlie is a self-taught artist who
says he has been drawing ever since he
‘‘picked up a pencil.’’ After a stint in
the Marine Corps, Charlie studied po-
litical science at the University of
North Carolina, and he started drawing
for the school newspaper. He moved to
Knoxville, where he started drawing at
what was known as the Knoxville Jour-
nal in 1958. That is when I first saw
Charlie Daniel’s cartoons. He worked
at the Journal until it closed in 1992
and then moved to the Knoxville News
Sentinel, where he has been ever since.
Some of his main subjects for his car-
toons have been sports, social causes,
and, of course, politics.
Over the years, Charlie has had plen-
ty of opportunity to skewer me, and he
has done it with vigor. Actually, it has
been honest, usually gentle, and always
effective. For example, as I was work-
ing on legislation, which became law
this past year, to ban the use of cell
phones on airplane flights, Charlie
drew a cartoon characterizing cell
phone yappers on long flights as the
‘‘perfect hell,’’ with the Devil asking
why he didn’t think of that.
Charlie’s drawings are well known
not just in Tennessee but all across our
country. In 2016, the National Cartoon-
ists Society honored Charlie with a
proclamation recognizing his career.
He was inducted to the sixth class of
the Tennessee Journalism Hall of Fame
last year, and the University of Ten-
nessee library has a special collections
department with more than 20,000 of
these drawings. There are about a
dozen that the University of Tennessee
doesn’t have because I have them in
my office or in my home.
Charlie’s contributions have been
recognized by Tennesseans for decades.
Our former Governor, Bill Haslam,
said: ‘‘For as long as I can remember,
Charlie has been making us laugh and
think.’’ Former Senate Majority Lead-
er Howard Baker, Jr., also from Knox-
ville, as is Governor Haslam, said Char-
lie was ‘‘the personification of civilized
relevant political humor.’’ Former
Knoxville mayor and Ambassador to
Poland, Victor Ashe, said: ‘‘Charlie
Daniel has been an icon and institution
across the country.’’
East Tennesseans have been fortu-
nate that Charlie and his family have
called our region home. For over six
decades, Charlie’s drawings have been
the first thing that I and many others
have looked for in the newspaper, and
it is going to be harder to start each
day without the humor and the touch
of Charlie Daniel.
Thank you, Charlie. Congratulations
to you on your retirement. I wish you
and Patsy and your family the best on
behalf of grateful Tennesseans.
I yield the floor.

Japan—Standard Missile–3 (SM–3) Missiles
The Government of Japan has requested to
buy two (2) AEGIS Weapon Systems (AWS),
two (2) Multi-Mission Signal Processors
(MMSP) and two (2) Command and Control
Processor (C2P) Refreshes. Also included is
radio navigation equipment, naval ordnance,
two (2) Identification Friend or Foe (IFF)
Systems, Global Command and Control Sys-
tem-Maritime (GCCS–M) hardware, and two
(2) Inertial Navigation Systems (INS), U.S.
Government and contractor representatives’
technical, engineering and logistics support
services, installation support material,
training, construction services for six (6)
vertical launch system launcher module en-
closures, communications equipment and as-
sociated spares, classified and unclassified
publications and software, and other related
elements of logistical and program support.
The total estimated program cost is $2.150
billion.
This proposed sale will contribute to the
foreign policy and national security of the
United States by improving the security of a
major ally that is a force for political sta-
bility and economic progress in the Asia-Pa-
cific region. It is vital to U.S. national inter-
ests to assist Japan in developing and main-
taining a strong and effective self-defense ca-
pability.
This proposed sale will provide the Govern-
ment of Japan with an enhanced capability
against increasingly sophisticated ballistic
missile threats and create an expanded, lay-
ered defense of its homeland. Japan, which
already has the AEGIS in its inventory, will
have no difficulty absorbing this system into
its armed forces.
The proposed sale of this equipment and
support does not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region.
The prime contractor for the Aegis Weapon
System and Multi-Mission Signal Processors
will be Lockheed Martin Rotary and Mission
Systems, Washington, DC. The Command
and Control Processor Refresh will be pro-
vided by General Dynamics, Falls Church,
VA.
There are no known offset agreements pro-
posed in connection with this potential sale.
Implementation of this proposed sale will
require annual trips to Japan involving U.S.
Government and contractor representatives
for technical reviews, support, and oversight
for approximately eight years.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed
sale.

viding information in certain categories de-
scribing its activities for the preceding year.
Reported below is the information describing
the Committee’s activities in 2018 in the cat-
egories set forth in the Act:
(1) The number of alleged violations of
Senate rules received from any source, in-
cluding the number raised by a Senator or
staff of the Committee: 138. (In addition, 6 al-
leged violations from the previous year were
carried into 2018.)
(2) The number of alleged violations that
were dismissed—
(A) For lack of subject matter jurisdiction
or in which, even if the allegations in the
complaint are true, no violation of Senate
rules would exist: 109. (This figure includes 1
matter from the previous year carried into
2018.)
(B) Because they failed to provide suffi-
cient facts as to any material violation of
the Senate rules beyond mere allegation or
assertion: 11. (This figure includes 1 matter

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO EVELYN ELLIS-
HAINES
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Madam President, for
the first Granite Stater of the Month
of 2019, I am proud to recognize fifth
grader Evelyn Ellis-Haines of Belmont
for her work helping those in need.
Through a youth civics program at her
school, Evelyn launched a clothing
drive, and with the support of her
teachers and classmates, she collected
more than 700 items to donate to some
of our most vulnerable citizens in the
Granite State.
Evelyn was inspired to start her
clothing drive because, in her words,
she ‘‘wanted to help people.’’ Address-
ing poverty is something that has al-
ways concerned Evelyn. Her family
even recalls her making baked goods to

give to people she saw experiencing
homelessness and often asking why
they could not do more to help them.
When the opportunity to participate in
New Hampshire’s Kid Governor Pro-
gram arose, Evelyn created a platform
based on addressing poverty and
worked with her school to start a
clothing drive. Every Monday in De-
cember, she reminded her classmates
during their school assembly to bring
items to donate, which resulted in her
collecting hundreds of items in just
under a month.
Evelyn donated the items to the larg-
est family shelter in her community
and wants to continue working to help
address poverty. She will be volun-
teering with the same organization
this summer and hopes to expand her
clothing drive beyond just her school.
For her efforts to support her commu-
nity and help those in need, I am proud
to recognize Evelyn as the January
2019 Granite Stater of the Month.∑

VERMONT STATE OF THE UNION
ESSAY WINNERS
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President,
since 2010 I have sponsored a State of
the Union essay contest for Vermont
high school students. This contest
gives students in my State the oppor-
tunity to articulate what issues they
would prioritize if they were President
of the United States.
This is the contest’s 9th year and I
would like to congratulate the almost
600 students who participated. It is
truly heartening to see so many young
people engaged in finding solutions for
the problems that face our country. To
my mind, this is what democracy is all
about.
A volunteer panel of Vermont teach-
ers reviewed the essays and chose
Firdaus Muhammad as this year’s win-
ner. Firdaus, a freshman at Essex High
School, focused on the rise of
Islamophobia across the Nation. Jack-
son Maiocco, a senior at Bellows Falls
Union High School, was the second
place winner. Jackson wrote about
military spending and the impact our
defense budget has on our Nation. Jo-
seph Brody, a senior at St. Johnsbury
Academy, was the third place winner,
having written about voter suppres-
sion.
I am very proud to enter into the
Congressional Record the essays sub-
mitted by Firdaus, Jackson, and Jo-
seph.
The material follows:
FIRDAUS MUHAMMAD, ESSEX HIGH SCHOOL,
FRESHMAN, WINNER
September 11, 2001—a day that all Ameri-
cans remember. A day that changed so many
lives. A day when I wasn’t even alive yet.
Yet 9/11 was a day that changed my life. Fast
forward eleven years to 2012. I was in third
grade and had just made the decision to start
wearing the hijab in public. I had awoken
that winter morning with the intention to
wear my hijab to school, but I was naive. I
didn’t know that by wearing the hijab, I be-
came a symbol of Islam. I didn’t realize that
by wearing a piece of cloth on my head, I was
suddenly a nine year old representing all 1.7
billion Muslims across the globe.
It’s 2019. Eighteen years have passed since
9/11. It’s been seven years since I started
wearing the hijab publicly. The racism
against Muslims has only gotten worse. The
hatred and Islamophobia has spread like
wildfire, affecting every Muslim in its path.
Women’s hijabs are being ripped off, racist
slurs are being spit at Muslims, and the
angry stares have only increased. The rise of
Islamophobia during these past years has
been exacerbated by President Trump’s
Travel Ban. On January 27, 2017, President
Trump signed the Protecting the Nation
from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the
United States Order. This became known as
the Travel Ban or essentially, the Muslim
Ban. Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen,
North Korea, and Venezuela were all affected
by this ban. It’s not a coincidence that five
of these countries have a majority Muslim
population.
I clearly remember watching the news with
my dad and hearing all the racist names
being thrown at Muslims. Being an eleven
year old Muslim girl, I couldn’t comprehend
how people could be so rude and racist to one
another. I didn’t understand why Muslim
families were suddenly being torn apart be-
cause they were deemed ‘‘unsafe’’. Why were
people suddenly so scared of Muslims? Didn’t
they know that Islam was a religion founded
on peace and justice? A religion of equality
and kindness? How can we live in ‘‘The Land
of the Free’’ when Muslims are afraid of
being targeted based solely on their religion?
I am lucky enough to live in Vermont where
most people are quite respectful and accept-
ing of each other. But I also know that there
are other Muslims who are not so lucky.
Those Muslims who feel isolated in their of-
fices, schools, and other public places.
I believe that in order to solve this huge
racial problem, we must learn to accept each
other’s differences. We should not discrimi-
nate against others based on their religion.
We need to make sure that we represent peo-
ple as they are, not based on stereotypes. We
cannot let the actions of a few people reflect
the beliefs of a whole religion. The United
States is a country of diversity, a country
built by immigrants. Any person who comes
from any religion, deserves to feel respected
and welcomed in this country.
JACKSON MAIOCCO, BELLOWS FALLS UNION
HIGH SCHOOL, SENIOR, SECOND PLACE
For decades, an excess of military spending
has plagued our nation while there are many
vital areas that would prosper with the re-
allocation of some military spending. The
majority of our nation’s federal budget is
dedicated to the military; in 2018, the US
spent a grand total of $623 billion on national
defense. This huge sum of money dwarfs the
amount that President Trump allocated to
the Department of Education: a mere $68 bil-
lion. I know that sounds like a considerable
amount of money, so I’ll put it in perspec-
tive. For every dollar spent on education,
nearly $11 went to the military. This simply
can’t stand.
In fiscal year 2018, the US Federal Budget
was roughly a trillion dollars. President
Trump made good on his promise to slash
federal budgets, but increased the defense
budget by almost 10%. Considering the size
of the defense budget, a 10% increase is huge:
$52 billion, to be exact. Areas that were neg-
atively affected by Trump’s budget cuts were
the Department of Education, which had a
14% budget slash, and the Department of
Health and Human Services, which lost 18%
of its federal funding. Every country’s main
goal should be the scientific and social ad-
vancement of their citizens and society as a
whole, so the damage done by Trump’s budg-
et cuts is incredibly detrimental to our na-
tion. Meanwhile, we’re pouring unprece-
dented amounts of money into building
tanks that will never see action; according
to Eric Husher, former Senior Balkan Intel-
ligence Analyst (1992–1996), there are over
4,000 M1 Abrams tanks sitting in the Nevada
desert collecting dust. Keep in mind that it
costs upwards of $4.3 million to assemble an
M1 Abrams. So collectively, there’s roughly
$17 billion worth of American taxpayers
money sitting in a parking lot in Nevada.
But wait, it gets worse. These tanks aren’t
being built for use; they’re simply being
built to keep a factory running. This need-
less military spending is incredibly detri-
mental to our country. Excessive military
expenditures results in slower economic
growth, and, as outlined above, is simply a
waste of money.
The only feasible solution is to gradually
decrease military spending, and invest those
funds into more worthwhile areas such as
education, science, and healthcare. Far right
hawks and conservatives might argue that a
drastic decrease in military expenditures
would leave us exposed and weak, but the
evidence states otherwise. In fact, even if we
cut our military budget by 80%, we would
still have military superiority in the world.
In the words of legendary journalist Hun-
ter S. Thompson, ‘‘Every Republican admin-
istration since 1952 has let the military-in-
dustrial complex loot the treasury and
plunge the nation into debt on the excuse of
a wartime economic emergency.’’ With no
such emergency anywhere in sight, our tax
dollars should be spent on more worthwhile
investments.
JOSEPH BRODY, ST. JOHNSBURY ACADEMY,
SENIOR, THIRD PLACE
Democracy was founded on the funda-
mental principle that the power of govern-
ment is derived from the consent of the gov-
erned. Throughout the course of our nation’s
history, this foundation has been fractured
by the disenfranchisement of low-income and
minority groups. The Jim Crow laws, for ex-
ample, prevented African Americans from
voting through poll taxes and literacy tests.
While the means of voter suppression have
become less glaring, the United States con-
tinues to systematically suppress underrep-
resented populations from exercising their
Fifteenth Amendment right. In order to en-
sure that our democracy is accessible and
fruitful for all, the United States must abol-
ish Voter ID laws and reform Election Day.
First of all, minorities are silenced by the
Voter ID laws. As Attorney General Eric
Holder simply stated, ‘‘We call those poll
taxes.’’ Voter ID laws inhibit minority vot-
ers because they present additional barriers
to an already problematic voting process.
Even though obtaining identification is often
touted as ‘‘free,’’ Harvard Law School as-
serts that the cost of supporting documents
can exceed $175. Given that minorities are
often in the lowest income brackets, this
price can be insurmountable and dispropor-
tionately prevents African Americans from
receiving identification. The Brennan Center
for Justice revealed that nearly 25% of Afri-
can Americans lack necessary identification
in comparison to just 8% of their white coun-
terparts. According to The University of San
Diego, the beneficiaries of Voter ID laws are
largely ‘‘whites and those on the political
right.’’ Clearly, this not only alienates mi-
norities, but produces politicians who are
not concerned with their interests. The solu-
tion is simple: eradicate Voter ID laws.
Though many express concern about voter
fraud, this fear is baseless. Professor Justin
Levitt confirms that there have only been 31
cases of credible voter impersonation since
2000. In short, Voter ID laws are a refur-
bished Poll Tax; under the mask of ‘‘fraud

prevention,’’ only the disenfranchised stand
to be silenced.
Election Day is a hindrance because it oc-
curs on a Tuesday. The working class cannot
afford lost wages or lost energy from stand-
ing in hours-long lines. The result of this
awkward timing: low-income Americans can-
not afford to vote. According to the Pew Re-
search Center, 63% of the most financially
secure Americans voted in the 2014 election,
while only 20% of the least financially secure
were able to make it to the poll. In effect,
the population that bears the greatest bur-
dens possesses the least political power. In
actuality, Election Day was established on a
Tuesday so that farmers wouldn’t miss
church or market day. The government
needs to act with a similar intent and align
Election Day with the schedule of the work-
ing class. It should be a federally mandated
holiday and stretch across Saturday and
Sunday. For those unable to vote, absentee
ballots should be guaranteed and expedited.
Ultimately, eliminating Voter ID laws and
reforming Election Day will make voting ac-
cessible to all Americans. Voting is at the
heart of democracy, and once this is realized,
the quality of life for all Americans will be
heightened.∑

200TH ANNIVERSARY OF ALABAMA
AND TUSCALOOSA
∑ Mr. SHELBY. Madam President,
today I wish to call attention to the
special significance of the year 2019 in
our great State of Alabama. This year
we celebrate the 200th anniversary of
our State and my hometown, the city
of Tuscaloosa.
Tuscaloosa was incorporated on De-
cember 13, 1819, which was one day be-
fore the State of Alabama was admit-
ted to the Union. Beginning in 1826 and
extending for more than two decades,
Tuscaloosa was the State capital of
Alabama. This period marked the his-
toric opening of the University of Ala-
bama, the construction of a stately
capitol building, and the city’s trans-
formation as a center for education,
healthcare, and industry. Strategically
situated on the banks of the Black
Warrior River, Tuscaloosa became a
thriving hub for foundries, cotton
mills, forestry, and marine commerce.
Founded in Tuscaloosa in 1831, the
University of Alabama, which is the be-
loved alma mater of my family along
with countless others, has become one
of America’s premier public research
universities. The Capstone of edu-
cation, the University serves the citi-
zens of Alabama as well as students,
faculty, and staff who come from
throughout the United States and
around the globe to pursue a world-
class education at both the under-
graduate and graduate levels. The uni-
versity proudly partners with Stillman
College and Shelton State Community
College, as well as an abundant com-
munity of K–12 schools, to hold stature
as a major center for educational ex-
cellence.
Today Tuscaloosa is recognized as
one of the region’s most economically
prosperous cities. International cor-
porations join homegrown industries
and businesses to provide a robust cli-
mate for job creation, industrial expan-
sion, and a quality of life that is envied
and admired by one and all. Rec-
reational amenities, cultural gems, and
championship athletic teams are leg-
endary.
On December 13, 2018, the Tuscaloosa
Bicentennial Commission dedicated Bi-
centennial Square in Government
Plaza, located in the heart of the city’s
burgeoning downtown district. Over
the next 12 months, citizens will join
together in a diverse calendar of events
and programs that will educate, cele-
brate, and feature 2019 as a year to re-
member.
I share in the RECORD a schedule of
events for ‘‘Tuscaloosa 200,’’ together
with the names of the bicentennial
commission members who, along with
dozens of other volunteers, have de-
voted countless hours to planning and
organizing the bicentennial commemo-
ration, as well as the companies whose
generosity made possible the extensive,
yearlong celebration: dedication of Bi-
centennial Square at Government
Plaza, December 13, 2018; ringing in
Tuscaloosa 200 bicentennial fireworks,
December 31, 2018, at the Tuscaloosa

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr.
BROWN, Mr. WHITEHOUSE, Mr.
CASEY, Mr. CARDIN, Ms.
DUCKWORTH, Mr. MERKLEY, Ms.
HARRIS, Ms. WARREN, Ms. COR-
TEZ MASTO, Ms. HIRONO, Ms.

S. 266. A bill to provide for the long-
term improvement of public school fa-
cilities, and for other purposes; to the
Committee on Finance.
Mr. REED. Mr. President, public
schools play a vital role in every com-
munity across the Nation. They play a
central role in our democracy—edu-
cating the next generation, serving as
polling places for our elections, hosting
community meetings and events, and
so much more. When there is a natural
disaster or an emergency, people often
gather at their public schools for shel-
ter, information, and resources. They
are essential facilities and must be in-
cluded in any new major federal invest-
ment in infrastructure. That is why I
am proud to partner with Chairman
SCOTT in the House of Representatives
in introducing the Rebuild America’s
Schools Act to fix our schools. I would
like to thank my Senate colleagues
who are joining in this effort, including
Senators BROWN, CORTEZ MASTO, HAS-
SAN, WARREN, WHITEHOUSE, CASEY,
CARDIN, DUCKWORTH, MERKLEY, HARRIS,
HIRONO, GILLIBRAND, VAN HOLLEN,
ROSEN, BLUMENTHAL, and SANDERS.
Safe, healthy, modern, well-equipped
schools are essential for advancing stu-
dent achievement and ensuring that
the next generation is prepared to meet
the economic, social, environmental,
and global challenges our nation faces.
Yet, too many of the over 50 million
students and six million staff who
learn and work in our public schools
spend their days in facilities that fail
to make the grade. A 2014 Department
of Education study estimated that it
would cost $197 billion to bring all pub-
lic schools into ‘‘good’’ condition. Na-
tionally, there is also a $38 billion
funding gap in annual capital construc-
tion and new facility funding, as re-
ported in the 2016 State of Our Schools
report. Despite the benefits and need,
however, Federal funding accounts for
0.2% of the total current capital invest-
ment in our schools.
State and local communities cannot
bridge this gap alone. Last November,

Rhode Island voters approved a general
obligation bond of $250 million dol-
lars—the largest statewide bond ever—
to upgrade our public school facilities.
However, the State had identified over
$2.2 billion in needed improvements to
school infrastructure. Rhode Island is
not the only State facing a school in-
frastructure crisis. In fact, the Amer-
ican Society of Civil Engineers gave
public school buildings across the
country an overall grade of D+ in their
2017 report card. The scope of the
school infrastructure crisis is more
than many, States or communities can
address on their own. The Federal gov-
ernment can and should be a partner in
upgrading our public school facilities.
Addressing this need is not only the
right thing to do for our students; it
will also give a needed boost to our
economy, putting people to work in
family sustaining jobs. According to an
analysis by the Economic Policy Insti-
tute, every $1 billion spent on con-
struction generates 17,785 jobs.
The Rebuild America’s Schools Act
of 2019 will create Federal-State part-
nership for school infrastructure. It
will provide, over ten years, a total of
$100 billion in direct grants and school
construction bonds to help fill the an-
nual gap in school facility capital
needs, while creating nearly two mil-
lion jobs.
Specifically, the Rebuild America’s
Schools Act will provide $7 billion per
year in formula funds to States for
local competitive grants for school re-
pair, renovation, and construction.
States will focus assistance on commu-
nities with the greatest financial need,
encourage green construction prac-
tices, and expand access to high-speed
broadband to ensure that all students
have access to digital learning. Our
legislation would also provide $30 bil-
lion for qualified school infrastructure
bonds (QSIBs), $10 billion each year
from FY 2020 through FY 2022, and re-
store the Qualified Zone Academy
Bonds (QZABS) that were eliminated in
the Republican Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
The legislation also eases the matching
requirements and expands the author-
ity and eligible purposes of QZABS to
allow local education agencies to con-
struct, rehabilitate, retrofit, or repair
school facilities. The Rebuild Amer-
ica’s Schools Act also supports Amer-
ican workers by ensuring that projects
use American-made iron, steel, and
manufactured products and meet labor
standards.
I would like to thank the broad coali-
tion of educators, community organiza-
tions, unions, civil rights advocates,
and employers that have provided feed-
back and support for this legislation,
including the American Federation of
Teachers, Association of Educational
Service Agencies, Association of
School Building Administrators Inter-
national, Brick Industry Association,
Californians for School Facilities,
Council of Great City Schools, Healthy
Schools Network, International Union
of Operating Engineers, International
Union of Painters and Allied Trades,

School Principals, National Associa-
tion of Federally Impacted Schools,

About Rural Education, Public Advo-
cacy for Kids, Rebuild America’s
Schools, Rural School and Community
Trust, Secure Schools Alliance, Teach
Plus, Twenty-First Century Schools
Fund, and U.S. Green Building Council.
We look forward to expanding this coa-
lition in the weeks and months ahead.
We have no time to waste in fixing
our deteriorating school infrastruc-
ture. In the words of a student activist
in Providence, ‘‘Students cannot learn
in a crumbling building, a school that
isn’t fit to uplift our minds.’’ We need
to listen to our students, strengthen
our communities, and improve our
school buildings. I urge all of our col-
leagues to support the Rebuild Amer-
ica’s Schools Act and press for its pas-
sage.

CORTEZ MASTO, Mr. SCHATZ, Ms. HAR-
RIS, and Mr. PETERS) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred
to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions:
S. RES. 34
Whereas, on August 25, 2017, attacks on se-
curity posts in Burma by the Arakan
Rohingya Salvation Army militant group re-
sulted in a brutal, systematic, and dispropor-
tionate reprisal by the Burmese military and
security forces on Rohingya villages in
Rakhine State;
Whereas approximately 700,000 Rohingya
refugees have fled to Bangladesh since the
Burmese military commenced its scorched-
earth campaign, with the burning of villages
and local monuments, and reports of wide-
spread gang rape, starvation, killing, and
forcible deportation;
Whereas the August 2018 United Nations
report of the Independent International
Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar states in
paragraph 87 that ‘‘the Mission concluded
. . . that there is sufficient information to
warrant the investigation and prosecution of
senior officials in the Tatmadaw chain of
command, so that a competent court can de-
termine their liability for genocide in rela-
tion to the situation in Rakhine State’’;
Whereas, on August 28, 2018, then-United
States Ambassador to the United Nations
Nikki Haley reported to the United Nations
Security Council that the Department of
State had conducted interviews with 1,024
Rohingya refugees in camps throughout
Cox’s Bazar and that the results of the inter-
views were consistent with the United Na-
tions Independent International Fact-Find-
ing Mission on Myanmar;
Whereas, on September 24, 2018, the De-
partment of State report titled, ‘‘Docu-
mentation of Atrocities in Northern Rakhine
State’’, concluded that the military’s at-
tacks in Burma’s Northern Rakhine State
were ‘‘large-scale, widespread and seemingly
geared toward both terrorizing the popu-
lation and driving out the Rohingya resi-
dents’’ and that the ‘‘scope and scale of the
military’s operations indicate that they were
well-planned and coordinated’’;
Whereas, on December 3, 2018, the United
States Holocaust Memorial Museum con-
cluded that ‘‘there is compelling evidence
that the Burmese military committed ethnic
cleansing, crimes against humanity, and
genocide against the Rohingya’’;
Whereas the Government of Burma has
consistently denied access to the United Na-
tions Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar es-
tablished to investigate human rights viola-
tions around the country;
Whereas the fundamental operational prin-
ciples of voluntary repatriation are safety,
to include legal and physical safety, and dig-
nity, to include treatment with respect and
full acceptance by their national authorities,
including the full restoration of refugees’
rights;
Whereas approximately 236,000 Rohingya
refugees returned to Burma from Bangladesh
under the terms of a 1992 agreement after a
previous bout of violence against the
Rohingya forced them to flee, only to con-
tinue to be denied citizenship, face prejudice,
violence, and persecution, and in many in-
stances be forced to live in internally dis-
placed persons (IDP) camps with their free-
dom of movement restricted;
Whereas Burma’s 1982 citizenship law
stripped Rohingya of their Burmese citizen-
ship, rendering them stateless;
Whereas the Government of Burma con-
tinues to systematically discriminate
against the Rohingya people, a long-per-
secuted Muslim minority within Burma, in-
cluding by continuing to restrict registra-
tion of Rohingya births and to deny them
freedom of movement, access to healthcare,
land, education, marriage, voting rights, and
political participation;
Whereas the Government of Burma has re-
peatedly abused land use laws to unjustly
seize land from Rohingya refugees;
Whereas the United Nations High Commis-
sion on Refugees (UNHCR) is working closely
with the Government of Bangladesh and
partners to provide protection and assistance
to the Rohingya refugees and to support the
host populations affected by the influx;
Whereas, on November 23, 2017, the Govern-
ment of Burma and the Government of Ban-
gladesh signed an agreement, known as the
‘‘Arrangement’’, on the return of displaced
persons from Rakhine State, which is mod-
eled after the 1992 repatriation agreement
between Burma and Bangladesh;

Whereas the Arrangement includes ref-
erences to restoring normalcy and human
rights in Rakhine State, for refugee returns
to comply with international standards of
safety, dignity, and voluntariness, and to
commencing a process to address root causes
in line with the Rakhine Advisory Commis-
sion recommendations;
Whereas the Department of State has as-
sessed that Burma has not made progress on
the ‘‘more crucial’’ of the 88 recommenda-
tions of the Rakhine Advisory Commission
that are identified by Rohingya refugees as
prerequisites to repatriation including free-
dom of movement, civil documentation, and
a transparent pathway to citizenship;
Whereas, on June 6, 2018, the Government
of Burma reached a tripartite Memorandum
of Understanding (MOU) with the UNHCR
and the United Nations Development Agency
(UNDP) on its role in the safe, dignified, and
voluntary return of Rakhine State refugees;
Whereas Rohingya refugees currently
hosted in Bangladesh demonstrated in pro-
test against an initial November 2018 repatri-
ation plan between the Governments of Ban-
gladesh and Burma, citing concerns for their
security and the lack of meaningful political
reforms in Burma to include full citizenship;
Whereas UNHCR, on January 4, 2019, re-
ported that conditions in Burma’s Rakhine
State remain ‘‘not conducive to return’’ on
the heels of the Government of India’s re-
grettable decision to repatriate 16,000
Rohingya to Burma without having first
ascertained the ‘‘voluntariness of their deci-
sion to return’’;
Whereas, throughout this process, the Gov-
ernment of Burma has restricted media free-
dom and jailed journalists;
Whereas, on December 12, 2017, Wa Lone
and Kyaw Soe Oo, two journalists reporting
and documenting atrocities against the
Rohingya, were arrested and on January 10,
2018, formally prosecuted with violating the
‘‘Official Secrets Act’’;
Whereas Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Soo had
uncovered a massacre of 10 Rohingya men
perpetrated by Burma’s security forces and
aided by local Buddhist villagers in the vil-
lage of Inn Din in Rakhine State;
Whereas, on September 3, 2018, Yangon
northern district judge Ye Lwin ruled that
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo breached the co-
lonial-era Official Secrets Act and sentenced
them each to seven years in prison with hard
labor;
Whereas, on January 11, 2019, Wa Lone and
Kyaw Soe Oo’s appeal of their conviction be-
fore the Yangon Regional High Court was de-
nied;
Whereas Time Magazine named Wa Lone
and Kyaw Soe Oo as co-recipients of 2018
Time Magazine’s ‘‘Person of the Year’’ in
recognition for their courageous reporting;
Whereas Vice President Mike Pence
tweeted his concern over the sentence
against Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo for
‘‘doing their job reporting on the atrocities
being committed on the Rohingya people’’;
Whereas United States Ambassador to the
United Nations Nikki Haley described the
conviction as ‘‘another terrible stain on the
Burmese government’’ and called for ‘‘their
immediate and unconditional release’’;
Whereas the Department of State’s annual
Human Rights Report on Burma for the year
2017 states that—
(1) ‘‘legal provisions that allow the govern-
ment to manipulate the courts for political
ends, and these provisions were sometimes
used to deprive citizens of due process and
the right to a fair trial, particularly with re-
gards to the freedom of expression’’;
(2) ‘‘The government continued to detain
and arrest journalists, activists, and critics
of the government and the military during
the year.’’; and
(3) ‘‘Threats against and arrests of journal-
ists increased . . . Freedom of expression was
more restricted during the year compared
with 2016. This included a higher number of
detentions of journalists using various laws,
including laws carrying more severe punish-
ments than those used previously.’’;
Whereas, according to PEN America, the
discontinuation of Radio Free Asia’s broad-
casting in Myanmar on a domestic channel
constitutes a further shrinking of the space
for free expression in the country; and
Whereas, additionally, PEN America re-
ports that—
(1) there continues to be increased legal
threats, imprisonment, and physical harass-
ment of journalists;
(2) there continues to be restrictions on
the ability to report from and receive infor-
mation on conflict areas; and
(3) the lack of reform of media laws and in-
stitutions is driving a decline in media free-
dom: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) condemns the violence and displace-
ment inflicted on Burma’s Rohingya and
other ethnic minorities;
(2) urges the Secretary of State to make a
determination whether the actions by the
Myanmar military constitute crimes against
humanity or genocide and to work with
interagency partners to impose targeted
sanctions on Myanmar military officials, to
include Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, re-
sponsible for these heinous acts through ex-
isting authorities;
(3) condemns the attacks by the Arakan
Rohingya Salvation Army militant group;
(4) calls on the Government of Burma to
allow full access to Rakhine State and en-
sure the full participation of UNHCR, the
internationally endorsed organization
tasked with ensuring that refugee returns
are voluntary, safe, dignified, and meet
international refugee and human rights
standards, and that the voices of refugees are
represented in order to ensure the sustain-
ability of such returns and to prevent fur-
ther waves of displacement;
(5) commends the positive role of the Gov-
ernment of Bangladesh in receiving
Rohingya refugees to date and urges the
Government of Bangladesh to continue al-
lowing the full participation of UNHCR and
human rights organization in accessing ref-
ugee camps;
(6) calls on UNHCR and international non-
governmental organizations to continue to
play a role in monitoring repatriation efforts
by the Governments of Bangladesh and
Burma to ensure a process that meets inter-
national norms for voluntary, safe, and dig-
nified repatriation;
(7) agrees that any return of Rohingya
should include guarantees that any returns
of refugees will be voluntary and dignified,
that there will be no threats to protection or
security upon return, that refugees will be
able to return to their places of origin or
other locations as desired, and be able to
enjoy equal rights with others in Burma, in-
cluding the restoration or granting of full
citizenship, freedom of movement, and ac-
cess to basic services;
(8) recognizes that any forced relocation of
Rohingya refugees into temporary settle-
ments, IDP camps, ‘‘model villages’’, or
other areas not of refugees’ choosing is unac-
ceptable;
(9) calls on the Government of Burma to
allow for a flexible and practical approach to
dealing with evidence of Rohingya residence
in Burma, recognizing that the Rohingya ref-
ugees in Bangladesh possess a wide range of
documents and that some refugees have no
documents and will need to establish their
residence by other means;
(10) calls on the Government of Burma to
address root causes consistent with the
Rakhine Advisory Commission recommenda-
tions and fully implement all of the rec-
ommendations of the Commission, including
providing equal access to full restoration or
granting of full citizenship for the Rohingya
population;
(11) calls on the Government of Burma to
acknowledge and address the issue of state-
lessness for the Rohingya, the deprivation of
rights, and institutionalized and pervasive
discrimination of the Rohingya population
in order to bring about any sustainable solu-
tions;
(12) commends the Government and the
people of Bangladesh for their extraordinary
generosity and efforts to provide shelter and
relief for nearly 1,000,000 Rohingya refugees
forced to flee their homes in Burma;
(13) calls on the Government of Bangladesh
to ensure all refugees have freedom of move-
ment and under no circumstances are subject
to unsafe, involuntary, precipitous, or unin-
formed returns to Burma;
(14) calls for all the convictions against Wa
Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo to be nullified, for
the similar charges against many other jour-
nalists currently awaiting trial to be
dropped, and for the immediate and uncondi-
tional release of these journalists;
(15) expresses concern about the Govern-
ment of Myanmar’s crackdown on journal-
ists and press freedom throughout the coun-
try;
(16) reaffirms the central role that inde-
pendent and professional journalism plays in
strengthening democratic governance, up-
holding the rule of law, mitigating conflict,
and informing public opinion around the
world; and
(17) calls upon the United States Govern-
ment to continue the United States status as
a top global donor nation to the humani-
tarian response in Burma and Bangladesh
and for the President’s fiscal year 2020 budg-
et request to reflect that longstanding
United States commitment.

Qaeda, responsible for the attacks of Sep-
tember 11, 2001, maintains a presence in Af-
ghanistan.
(2) The Islamic State of Iraq and al Sham,
better known by its acronym ISIS, flour-
ished in the chaos unleashed by the civil war
in Syria and at one point controlled exten-
sive territory in Iraq and Syria.
(3) Al Qaeda, ISIS, and their affiliates have
murdered thousands of innocent civilians.
(4) Al Qaeda, ISIS, and their affiliates have
proven resilient and have regrouped when
the United States and its partners have
withdrawn from the fight against them.

military and our partners have made signifi-
cant progress in the campaign against al
Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and al

and ISIS, which maintain an ability to oper-
ate in Syria and Afghanistan;
(3) expresses concern that Iran has sup-
ported the Taliban in Afghanistan and
Hizballah and the Assad regime in Syria, and
has sought to frustrate diplomatic efforts to
resolve conflicts in these two countries;
(4) recognizes the positive role the United
States and its partners have played in Syria
and Afghanistan fighting terrorist groups,
countering Iranian aggression, deterring the
further use of chemical weapons, and pro-
tecting human rights;
(5) warns that a precipitous withdrawal of
United States forces from the on-going fight
against these groups, without effective,
countervailing efforts to secure gains in
Syria and Afghanistan, could allow terror-
ists to regroup, destabilize critical regions,
and create vacuums that could be filled by
Iran or Russia, to the detriment of United
States interests and those of our allies;
(6) recognizes that al Qaeda and ISIS pose
a global threat, which merits increased
international contributions to the counter-
terrorism, diplomatic, and stabilization ef-
forts underway in Syria and Afghanistan;
(7) recognizes that diplomatic efforts to se-
cure peaceful, negotiated solutions to the
conflicts in Syria and Afghanistan are nec-
essary to long-term stability and counterter-
rorism efforts in the Middle East and South
Asia;
(8) acknowledges the progress made by
Special Representative Khalilzad in his ef-
forts to promote reconciliation in Afghani-
stan;
(9) calls upon the Administration to con-
duct a thorough review of the military and
diplomatic strategies in Syria and Afghani-
stan, including an assessment of the risk
that withdrawal from those countries could
strengthen the power and influence of Russia
and Iran in the Middle East and South Asia
and undermine diplomatic efforts toward ne-
gotiated, peaceful solutions;
(10) requests that the Administration, as
part of this review, solicit the views of
Israel, our regional partners, and other key
troop-contributing nations in the fight
against al Qaeda and ISIS;
(11) reiterates support for international
diplomatic efforts to facilitate peaceful, ne-
gotiated resolutions to the on-going conflicts
in Syria and Afghanistan on terms that re-
spect the rights of innocent civilians and
deny safe havens to terrorists;
(12) calls upon the Administration to pur-
sue a strategy that sets the conditions for
the long-term defeat of al Qaeda and ISIS, as
well as the protection of regional partners
and allies, while ensuring that Iran cannot
dominate the region or threaten Israel;
(13) encourages close collaboration be-
tween the Executive Branch and the Legisla-
tive Branch to ensure continuing strong, bi-
partisan support for United States military
operations in Syria and Afghanistan; and
(14) calls upon the Administration to cer-
tify that conditions have been met for the
enduring defeat of al Qaeda and ISIS before
initiating any significant withdrawal of
United States forces from Syria or Afghani-
stan.

SEC. 336. REPORT ON UNITED STATES POLICY IN
SYRIA.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings:
(1) The regime of Bashar al Assad has com-
mitted gross atrocities against the people of
Syria.
(2) The commission of these atrocities led
to the eruption, and continuation, of the
Syrian civil war.
(3) The ensuing conflict has resulted in the
death of over 400,000 Syrian civilians.
(4) The Syrian civil war has caused over
5,500,000 Syrians to flee their country as ref-
ugees and over 6,000,000 others to be dis-
placed from their homes inside Syria.
(5) The Assad regime has repeatedly used
chemical weapons against its own people.
(6) In 2011 the Assad regime released from
its prisons many of the terrorists who would
subsequently lead the Islamic State in Iraq
and Syria (ISIS).
(7) ISIS has organized, executed, and in-
spired countless terror attacks throughout
the world since its emergence, including in
the United States.
(8) By the end of 2014, ISIS controlled one
third of the territory of Syria and one third
of the territory of Iraq.
(9) Since 2014, the United States has led
Operation Inherent Resolve, with the help of
allies, to degrade and destroy ISIS.
(10) Approximately 2,000 members of the
United States Armed Forces are deployed to
Syria under Operation Inherent Resolve.
(11) The United States and its allies have
succeeded in seizing back nearly all the
physical territory held by ISIS in 2014.
(12) Tens of thousands of ISIS terrorists re-
main in Syria and Iraq despite having lost
much of their territorial ‘‘Caliphate’’.
(13) The Islamic State continues to pose a
threat to the security of the United States
and that of its allies.
(14) Syrian Kurdish fighters in the People’s
Protection Units, or YPG, have served as ef-
fective and trustworthy allies in the fight
against ISIS.
(15) The Government of Turkey views these
Kurdish forces as an enemy and has ex-
pressed its intention to destroy them.
(16) The support of the Russian and Iranian
regimes in Syria has been invaluable to the
reinforcement of the Assad government.
(17) Russian-backed forces have directly
assaulted United States Armed Forces de-
ployed in Syria on at least one occasion.
(18) The Government of Iran seeks to en-
trench its presence in Syria as a means of
supporting its terrorist proxies, like
Hezbollah and Hamas, and harming its en-
emies, like Israel.
(19) Ensuring the existence of Israel, Amer-
ica’s most important ally in the Middle East,
remains a key United States interest in the
region.
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that—
(1) the pursuit of a clear, publicly-articu-
lated strategy will guide any withdrawal of
United States Armed Forces in Syria;
(2) such a strategy recognizes that ISIS
and al Qaeda terrorists in Syria continue to
pose a threat to the United States and its al-
lies;
(3) such a strategy includes among its ob-
jectives the complete degradation and long-
term destruction of ISIS;
(4) such a strategy will seek to prevent the
emergence of another terrorist group in
Syria capable of threatening the security of
the United States once ISIS is defeated;
(5) such a strategy includes the consider-
ation of and planning for the security inter-
ests of the Syrian Kurdish allies of the
United States;
(6) such a strategy recognizes the desta-
bilizing impact of Iran in Syria;
(7) such a strategy aims to ensure that Ira-
nian-commanded forces in Syria do not ben-
efit from the withdrawal of the United
States Armed Forces; and
(8) such a strategy aims to ensure that the
Syrian civil war ends through peaceful, po-
litical means.
(c) REPORT.—

after the date of the enactment of this Act,
the President shall submit to Congress a re-
port detailing United States policy in Syria.

(2) The late Libyan dictator Moammar
Gadhafi blocked Israel from obtaining ob-

(3) Israel, in the span of a few decades, has
emerged as a developed nation and therefore
offers an example of a path to economic
progress for developing countries.

able partner to many African nations, culti-
vating strong numerous bilateral relation-
ships across the continent.

tween Israel and African nations, particu-
larly in areas that are significant in progress
towards the implementation of the Sustain-
able Development Goals;

status to Israel by the African Union will
help enable such cooperation to develop be-
tween Israel and the African Union; and

server status.

TITLE V—GENERAL PROVISIONS
SEC. 501. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONDEMNING
THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN FOR ITS
SUPPORT OF MILITANT GROUPS
THAT THREATEN THE SECURITY OF
THE UNITED STATES AND ITS AL-
LIES AND STRATEGIC PARTNERS.
(a) FINDINGS.—The Senate makes the fol-
lowing findings:
(1) ) The goals of the Government of Iran
are to expand its regional influence by mili-
tary means and by destabilizing its neigh-
bors by all means.
(2) Since 1979, the Iranian regime has en-
gaged in various destabilizing activities that
undermine the national security of the
United States and its regional allies and
partners.
(3) The Government of Iran does this by
providing a wide range of support to militant
groups and by increasing its nuclear and con-
ventional capability.
(4) The Department of State has designated
Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism since
1984 and has characterized Iran as the ‘‘most
active state sponsor of terrorism’’ in the
world.
(5) Iranian leadership has repeatedly called
for the destruction of the United States and
Israel.
(6) According to the Department of State’s
Country Reports on Terrorism, Iran has
armed Hizballah, Hamas and other terrorist
organizations, providing hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars in support, and training
thousands of their fighters.
(7) Weapons supplied by the Government of
Iran have targeted United States citizens,
most notably the Iranian-supplied Explo-
sively Formed Projectiles, the most deadly
and sophisticated Improvised Explosive De-
vices (IEDs) on the battlefield, which have
killed and injured thousands of members of
the United States Armed Forces in Iraq.
(8) Thwarting Iran’s hegemonic ambitions
in the region brings long-term peace and sta-
bility, which thereby promotes the security
of the United States and our partners.
(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense
of the Senate that—
(1) the United States Government should
reaffirm its commitment not to equip the
Government of Iran with the material and
strategic means to further finance or expand
acts of terrorism; and
(2) the United States Government should
reaffirm its commitment to encourage global
and regional security in the Middle East by
strongly supporting allies and strategic part-
ners.

CELEBRATING BLACK HISTORY
MONTH
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, January 29, 2019
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with
great respect and sincere admiration that I rise
today to celebrate Black History Month and its
2019 theme—Black Migrations. This year’s
theme reflects on the mass movement of Afri-
can Americans from the rural south to north-
ern, western, and mid-western cities of the
United States from approximately 1916 to
1970. This profound movement has played a
critical role in changing the landscape of
American society for the better and has
helped to shape our wonderfully diverse and
truly remarkable nation.
During World War I, the first large migra-
tions took place, with over 400,000 African
Americans moving from the south and inhab-
iting major northern cities such as Chicago,
Detroit, and Pittsburgh. In the 1920s, another
800,000 people left the south, followed by an-
other 400,000 in the 1930s. Between 1940
and 1960, over 3,300,000 African Americans
had migrated from southern states to resettle
in northern and western cities. While there
were numerous reasons for this migration,
many individuals and families were hoping to
escape the economic oppression they were
experiencing in the south, which left little room
for economic growth. World War I created a
demand for workers in the steel mills, fac-
tories, and railroads, and most people moved
for higher paying jobs. When the migration
began, a factory wage in the north was more
than three times the amount an African Amer-
ican could expect to make working the land in
the south. By World War II, African American
people continued to move north but also set-
tled west, in California, Oregon, and Wash-
ington.
Black migration influenced religion, music,
literature, arts, social perspectives, tradition,
and the history of our nation, and we are for-
ever grateful for the impact it had on creating
a rich, culturally diverse America. In addition,
African Americans now had a new voice in
shaping public policy through political activism.
However, while the movement brought more
opportunity and ideas, African Americans con-
tinued to fight with racism, prejudice, and in-
justice. During this time, there were numerous
race riots in the north, including the Chicago
Race Riot of 1919, which lasted thirteen days,
leaving 38 people dead, 537 people injured,
and 1,000 black families without homes. While
our great country has made tremendous
strides in the fight for equality and civil rights,
there is much work to be done.
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my dis-
tinguished colleagues join me in celebrating
Black History Month. This month and always,
it is important that we honor and celebrate
America’s greatest advocates for equal rights
and civil liberties. As we pay tribute to these
heroes of American history, let us remember
their profound perseverance, sacrifice, and
struggle in the fight for freedom and equality,
and the remarkable impact their contributions
have had in shaping our great nation.

RECOGNIZING RABBI DAVID
STEINHARDT’S 25 YEARS OF
DEDICATED SERVICE TO B’NAI
TORAH CONGREGATION
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, January 29, 2019
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to rise today in recognition of the impor-
tant work done by Rabbi David Steinhardt of
B’nai Torah Congregation.
For 25 years, Rabbi Steinhardt has offered
a religious home in the B’nai Torah congrega-
tion. As a member myself, the Rabbi has
brought words of wisdom, healing, and inspira-
tion to me, my family, and the Jewish commu-
nity of Boca Raton. His deep commitment to
teaching and advancing Jewish values has
brought B’nai Torah to preeminence. His ser-
mons reinforce our values and provide spir-
itual guidance, and his deep commitment to
Israel is most appreciated by our community.
For these 25 years of leadership, I am grateful
for Rabbi Steinhardt.
In times of hardship, such as after the
shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas, Rabbi
Steinhardt has created a space for mourning
and healing within B’nai Torah. After the Tree
of Life synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, he
welcomed local leaders of all religious denomi-
nations for a powerful community-wide vigil.
Rabbi Steinhardt’s work with the Interfaith
Clergy Association has contributed signifi-
cantly to the strength of our broader commu-
nity.
As we begin this new year, I am confident
Rabbi David Steinhardt will continue to be a
cherished member of the Boca Raton commu-
nity. I greatly appreciate Rabbi Steinhardt’s
dedication to the congregants of B’nai Torah
and the people of South Florida, and I am
pleased to honor him.

CHRISTIAN BANZIGER EARNS THE
RANK OF EAGLE SCOUT
HON. PETE OLSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, January 29, 2019
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to congratulate Christian Banziger of Sugar
Land, TX for earning the rank of Eagle Scout.
Eagle Scout is the highest honor a Boy Scout
can earn.
Only a small percentage of Boy Scouts
reach the rank of Eagle Scout. This honor re-
quires years of effort to develop the necessary
leadership, service and outdoor skills. To earn
it, Christian developed and provided leader-
ship to others in a service project. For his
project, Christian built a table and benches for
the Arya Samaj Greater Houston and Vedic
Culture Center. His dedication to our commu-
nity has prepared him to be a leader in his fu-
ture career. The leadership skills he has
learned through Boy Scouts are already bene-
fiting our community, just as the contributions
of Boy Scouts continue to benefit our commu-
nities in countless ways.
On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-
sional District of Texas, congratulations again
to Christian Banziger for becoming an Eagle
Scout. We are proud of his continued success
and thank him for his dedication to making our
community a better place.

CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF BIG BROTHERS BIG
SISTERS OF CENTRAL CALI-
FORNIA
HON. JIM COSTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, January 29, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
commemorate Big Brothers Big Sisters of
Central California (BBBS) on the occasion of
their 50th anniversary. Since its creation,
BBBS has assisted in establishing meaningful,
professional, and long-lasting relationships be-
tween adult volunteers and young adults.
Big Brothers of America was created in
1904, by Ernest Kent Coulter. Ernest worked
as a children’s court clerk in New York City
and watched countless young boys shuffle in
and out of the courtroom. He believed that if
caring adults could guide and help the chil-
dren, they could stay away from trouble and
grow up to become productive members of
their community. At the same time, members
of the organization Ladies of Charity, were
maintaining friendships with young girls who
had gone through the New York children’s
court. This organization would become the
Catholic Big Sisters. This growing movement
of mentorship brought caring role models into
the lives of children across the nation.
In 1946, the United States Congress recog-
nized Big Brothers of America as a social wel-
fare organization. The simultaneous growth of
the two organizations led to the merging of Big
Brothers of America and Big Sisters of Amer-
ica into Big Brothers Big Sisters of America in
1977.
Locally, Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central
California has served over 20,000 children and
their families. In 1997, satellite offices were
opened in Hanford and Madera, to cover an
expanded service area of Kings and Madera
counties. Expanding yet again, in late 2007
BBBS merged with Big Brothers Big Sisters of
Tulare County and became the Big Brothers
Big Sisters of Central California to reflect their
new region. Today, BBBS Central California

Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in recognizing Big Brothers Big Sisters of
Central California’s 50th anniversary. I com-
mend the service of all past and present mem-
bers of this organization, who have worked
collectively to motivate, promote, support, and
educate children and young adults in Central
California.

SUPPORT FOR H.R. 367, THE PAY
OUR COAST GUARD PARITY ACT
OF 2019
HON. DON YOUNG
OF ALASKA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, January 29, 2019
Mr. YOUNG. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to address the unfortunate position the brave
members of our Coast Guard were put in due
to the recent shutdown. Even while they oper-
ated without pay, these courageous men and
women continued to serve our country and I
would like to highlight some of their stories.
On January 12th, a Coast Guard aircrew re-
sponded to two surfers in distress off the Or-
egon Coast who had been pushed by the surf
into a cliffside cove. Once on scene, the crew
was able to hoist the surfers out of the water
and get them to safety. On Christmas Eve of
last year, the Coast Guard interdicted a mi-
grant boat off the coast of the Dominican Re-
public. Onboard, the crews found 100 kilo-
grams of cocaine heading for the United
States. On January 6th, the Coast Guard Cut-
ter Vigilant assisted the Haitian government in
stopping a small boat dangerously overloaded
with 70 Haitian migrants. The Coast Guard
worked jointly with Haiti to stop the illegal im-
migration and maintain the safety of life at
sea, something they regularly work with inter-
national partners to accomplish.
These are just a few examples of the great
work our Coast Guard does every day to pro-
tect the people in and around our waterways
as well as in our country. Yet unlike the other
branches in our armed forces who selflessly
serve this country, our Coast Guard men and
women were not getting compensated for their
work during the shutdown. In 2013, Congress
passed the Pay Our Military Act before a shut-
down began to make sure members in the
armed forces were able to collect their pay-
checks. I emphasize that this was done before
the 2013 shutdown because we just went a lit-
tle over a month in one and even with intro-
duced legislation to make sure our Coast
Guard got paid, we didn’t act on it.
There were 41,000 Active Duty Coast Guard
members, 6,200 reservists, and 8,500 civilian
personnel affected by the shutdown. It is esti-
mated that 31 percent of Active Duty members
do not have the savings needed to cover one
month’s worth of expenses. Moreover, some
13 percent do not have any emergency sav-
ings at all. This is not to mention the other
benefits the Service members were missing
out on like child care programs, death bene-
fits, housing allowances, and required travel
costs. Meanwhile, the negative impact on re-
cruiting and retention of members due to the
instability will likely have lasting effects long
after the shutdown.
My state is home to U.S. Coast Guard Base
Kodiak, the largest Coast Guard base in the
nation. From there, they coordinate a mul-
titude of operations in the waters around Alas-
ka, including north in the Arctic. They patrol
our waters to ensure the proper adherence of
fishing laws and regulations, coordinate
search and rescue efforts, help establish and
maintain aids to navigation, and conduct other
missions to help save lives and strengthen na-
tional security. As the United States’ only sur-
face presence in the Arctic, their mission to
ensure safe maritime activity and safeguard
national security has gained importance due to
the growing presence of Russia and China in
the region. This mission is sure to only be-
come even more significant as these foreign
powers continue to expand their influence.
Madam Speaker, I could go on about the
many great things our Coast Guard does for
both the state of Alaska and the United States
as a whole, but I believe it is well understood
in this chamber and across the country. With
the threat of another shutdown in the near fu-
ture, I fear that the members of our Coast
Guard will be put in the same position again.
That is why I urge we move to immediately
bring up and pass H.R. 367, the Pay Our
Coast Guard Parity Act of 2019, to make sure
they are compensated moving forward. Mean-
while, I call on all members in Congress to
come to the table and work with the Adminis-
tration so that we can make a long-term
agreement that is beneficial for all federal em-
ployees and prevent another shutdown.

THE FLOOD INSURANCE FOR
FARMERS ACT OF 2019
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, January 29, 2019
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I
introduce the ‘‘Flood Insurance for Farmers
Act of 2019,’’ with my colleague Congressman
DOUG LAMALFA (R–CA). This bipartisan bill
builds upon the ‘‘Flood and Agriculture Risk
Management (FARM) Cost Reduction Act of
2017’’ and legislation I sponsored in the 114th
Congress.
The ‘‘Flood Insurance for Farmers Act of
2019’’ would provide access to discounted
rates under the National Flood Insurance Pro-
gram to families who have farmed the Sac-
ramento Valley floodplain for generations. This
will help keep agricultural land in production,
which is the best way to push back against ir-
responsible subdivisions in the floodplain that
place lives at risk and force farms onto the
auction block.
Under current law, areas designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) as ‘‘Special Flood Hazard Areas’’ re-
quire that all new, expanded, or repaired
structures be raised above potential flood
level. In much of the Sacramento Valley, this
would require raising barns and silos upwards
of 10 feet, which is cost prohibitive for many
farmers or simply inconsistent with continued
agricultural land use.
Currently, FEMA assumes there is zero pro-
tection if a levee does not meet the federally
mandated 100-year level of flood protection
and charges full-cost rates under the National
Flood Insurance Program. This effectively pre-
cludes Sacramento Valley farmers from mak-
ing capital improvements on their operations
or securing the necessary financing for such
capital improvements. Our bipartisan bill would
lift this de facto federal prohibition on new
construction and repairs of agricultural struc-
tures in high flood-risk areas designated by
FEMA.
Specifically, the ‘‘Flood Insurance for Farm-
ers Act’’ would direct FEMA to develop a new
flood mapping zone for basins in the Sac-
ramento Valley and elsewhere nationwide pro-
tected by levees that do not currently meet the
federally mandated 100-year level of flood pro-
tection. Rates charged under the National
Flood Insurance Program in this new flood
zone would be based on actuarial risk. This
means that if levees provide a 50-year level of
flood protection, FEMA would charge rates
based on that discounted risk level. This en-
sures that farming families can get more af-
fordable flood insurance that reflects the lev-
ees they pay to upkeep.
The ‘‘Flood Insurance for Farmers Act’’ is
endorsed by the California Rice Commission,
USA Rice Federation, American Farm Bureau
Federation, California Farm Bureau Federa-
tion, Sacramento County Farm Bureau, Yuba-
Sutter Farm Bureau, Yolo County Farm Bu-
reau, California Cattlemen’s Association, Dairy
Institute of California, and the Sutter Butte
Flood Control Agency.
I thank Congressman LAMALFA for his sup-
port as the bill’s original cosponsor and look
forward to continuing to work together on this
critical issue for Sacramento Valley farmers. I
also want to thank all the California-based and
national organizations that have endorsed the
bill, to date.
Madam Speaker, I hope that Congress will
include the ‘‘Flood Insurance for Farmers Act’’
in any reauthorization of the National Flood In-
surance Program. I urge all Members to join
me and Congressman LAMALFA in cospon-
soring this important legislation for American
farmers.

that these institutions instill serve as a strong
foundation for a devoted relationship with God
and inform our daily lives with lessons of faith.

TRIBUTE TO COMMAND CHIEF
MASTER SERGEANT ERICKA E.
KELLY
HON. KEN CALVERT
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, January 29, 2019
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, today I
wish to recognize Command Chief Master
Sergeant Ericka E. Kelly, upon her retirement
after 32 years of distinguished military service
to our great Nation in the United States Air
Force and Air Force Reserve.
Chief Kelly’s career culminated with her final
assignment as both the Senior Enlisted Advi-
sor to the Chief of the Air Force Reserve,
Headquarters U.S. Air Force, Washington,
D.C., and Command Chief of the Air Force
Reserve Command, Robins Air Force Base,
Georgia. Chief Kelly represents the highest
enlisted executive level of leadership in Air
Force Reserve Command and advises the
commander on all issues regarding the readi-
ness, training, welfare, morale, proper utiliza-
tion and progress of more than 55,000 en-
listed Citizen Airmen. She also provides direc-
tion to the Reserve force and represents their
interests at all levels of government to other
military branches and in joint strategic and
operational war-fighting environments.
Chief Master Sergeant Kelly came from ex-
ceptionally humble beginnings in Guatemala
and overcame extreme adversity to achieve
her American dream. Immigrating to the
United States at the age of 12, she had to
work full-time to help support her family before
finishing high school at night to earn her di-
ploma. Knowing from a young age she wanted
to serve in our nation’s military, her dogged
determination is the epitome of personal resil-
ience.
Chief Kelly’s career began in the medical
field as a medical services specialist. Recog-
nizing her talents, the Air Force challenged
her through increased responsibilities and she
continued to grow and excel as an
aeromedical evacuation crew member with
over 1,400 flight hours on various airframes.
Chief Kelly has deployed numerous times in
support of contingency operations around the
world including Restore Hope and Operations
Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.
In addition to her military service, Chief
Kelly has more than 20 years of government,
management and law enforcement experi-
ence. She has served as a field agent and
criminal investigator for the Department of
Justice in numerous agencies including the
Office of Professional Responsibility. She is
also a John Maxwell certified speaker, coach
and trainer.
Throughout her tenure, Chief Kelly has been
instrumental in advocating for Reservists
across the globe and strengthening the total
force team. She has ensured Air Force Re-
serve interests and total force solutions were
highlighted and incorporated into decisions
made at the highest levels of the Air Force
guaranteeing Air Force Reserve Airmen were
ready to answer our nation’s call.
Due to Chief Master Sergeant Ericka Kelly’s
visionary leadership, foresight and ceaseless
efforts, the Air Force, the Department of De-
fense, and the Nation will long reap the bene-
fits of her many years of service. It is experi-
enced, dedicated, professional Citizen Airmen
like Chief Master Sergeant Kelly who make
the Department of Defense and the Air Force
Reserve the outstanding institutions that they
are today.
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United
States Congress and a grateful Nation, I ex-
tend our deepest appreciation to Chief Master
Sergeant Ericka E. Kelly for her many years of
dedicated service. There is no question the Air
Force, Department of Defense, and the United
States benefited greatly from Chief Kelly’s vi-
sionary leadership, planning and foresight, and
we wish her the very best.

RECOGNIZING CHIEF JEREMY
DESSELLIER FOR HIS LEADER-
SHIP AND HEROISM
HON. JACK BERGMAN
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, January 29, 2019
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it’s my
honor to recognize Chief Jeremy Dessellier of
the Hubbell Fire Department for his leadership
and heroism following the 2018 Father’s Day
flooding in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
Through his actions, Chief Dessellier has
shown himself to be selfless, courageous, and
an indispensable part of Michigan’s First Dis-
trict.
During the 2018 Father’s Day weekend,
multiple rounds of heavy rain fell across much
of the Upper Peninsula. Almost 7 inches of
rain came down on the Keweenaw Peninsula
overnight, creating flash floods that washed
out roads, destroyed homes, and caused mas-
sive damage to the area. A state of disaster
was declared as the community came together
to rescue those in danger and begin recovery
efforts. Local first responders joined with state
officials, the Red Cross, and hundreds of vol-
unteers to help the region rebuild.
In the days and weeks following the flood-
ing, the leadership of Chief Dessellier was crit-
ical to the success of these efforts. He took
calls and meetings with residents, organized
supplies, led volunteers, and went above and
beyond the call of duty to ensure the health
and well-being of those in his fire precinct and
beyond. Under his leadership, volunteers were
able to ensure the safety of community mem-
bers and move significant amounts of earth
and water from local homes and streets. The
heroic actions of Chief Dessellier and his vol-
unteers serve as an inspiration for those in
Michigan’s First District. His devotion to public
duty has touched the lives of countless
Michiganders, and the impact of his heroism
cannot be overstated.
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to recognize
Chief Jeremy Dessellier for his exceptional
leadership and heroism. Michiganders can
take great pride in knowing the First District is
home to such a selfless and courageous indi-
vidual. On behalf of my constituents, I wish
Chief Dessellier all the best in his future en-
deavors.

RILEY S. KUZNIA
HON. COLLIN C. PETERSON
OF MINNESOTA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, January 29, 2019
Mr. PETERSON. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life of Lance Corporal Riley
S. Kuznia of Karlstad, Minnesota who was
tragically killed at the age of 20 from an acci-
dental weapon discharge on January 1, 2019
at the Marine Barracks in Washington, D.C.
From a young age, Lance Corporal Kuznia
wanted to serve in the military and committed
himself to protecting our country.
Lance Corporal Kuznia’s leadership abilities
were evident from the very beginning of his
service. After graduating from Tri-County High
School in 2017, he joined the Marine Corps
within days of turning 18. He was soon serv-
ing on active duty at the Marine Barracks in
Washington, D.C., the oldest post of the
Corps, and responsible for post security and
policing at the barracks. According to the Star
Tribune, the post’s commanding officer, Colo-
nel Don Tomich, said, ‘‘Riley was a highly
driven and goal-oriented Marine whose posi-
tive attitude set the example here at the bar-
racks.’’ It was clear that he loved serving in
the Marine Corps, and he had a bright future
ahead of him.
I wish to extend my condolences to the fam-
ily of Lance Corporal Kuznia. He was a bright
young man whose discipline and commitment
should be admired by this Congress.

Tuesday, January 29, 2019
Mr. STIVERS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
on behalf of the people of Ohio’s Fifteenth
Congressional District and join with my col-
league, Mr. RUPPERSBERGER, to commemorate
the fortieth anniversary of the National Asso-
ciation of Bond Lawyers.
Since its inception in 1979, the National As-
sociation of Bond Lawyers has worked dili-
gently to advance the integrity and knowledge
of the municipal market. Through the edu-
cation of its members and other public finance
stakeholders, the Association has aided count-
less communities in finding creative financing
opportunities to reach their goals.
As Co-Chairs of the House of Representa-
tives Municipal Finance Caucus, we appre-
ciate the Association’s continued commitment
to education and the expertise its Members
are able to provide relating to legislation, regu-
lations, and rulings affecting tax-exempt bonds
and taxable bonds, as well as court and ad-
ministrative proceedings. These bonds are a
crucial funding source for the critical infrastruc-
ture that spans our nation, delivering essential
services and uniting millions of Americans.
United by a common goal and working for
the public good, the Association has been an
important partner for Congress, industry part-
ners, and federal regulators. Never straying
from its core mission, education, the forum the
Association provides has led to advancements
in the field of public finance for the past four
decades.
We wish to congratulate President Dee
Wisor and the entire Executive Board, and the
dedicated Members across the country, as
they commemorate this milestone on February

celebrate the life of Sheri Bohigian, who
passed away on December 20, 2018 at the
age of 72. Sheri will be remembered as a lov-
ing wife, mother and dedicated member of our
community. It is both fitting and appropriate
that we honor Sheri for her dedication to our
Valley.
Sheri was born on November 11, 1946 in
Fresno, California to Kent and Nikki Bowlan.
Her father was a Colonel in the United States
Air Force, which required the family to move
frequently. They traveled to Scotland, the Mar-
shall Islands, Alaska, Illinois, Seattle, San
Francisco, and Los Angeles. Traveling be-
came one of Sheri’s favorite things to do.
Sheri’s parents gave her the motivation she
needed to help her believe in herself. Her
mother’s outgoing personality and father’s
humble traits shaped her into a selfless, eating
young lady. These traits went along with her
everywhere she went.
Sheri attended the University of Missouri,
where she earned a Bachelor of Arts in Jour-
nalism. She then met the love of her life Tom
Bohigian. They were blessed with one son,
Stephen. Throughout their marriage Sheri and
Tom shared many memorable moments, trav-
eling and camping at Lake Tahoe, Yosemite,
and Kings Canyon National Park and explor-
ing parts of Europe together. Sheri also en-
joyed the company of her many dear friends,
frequently hosting dinners and gatherings in
her home.
Sheri served her community in a number of
ways. She was on the Board of Directors and
volunteered for the San Joaquin River Park-
way. Sheri retired from the San Joaquin Valley
Air District after nine years of service. She
cared about the world around her and hoped
to leave it a better place for generations to
come.
Sheri is survived by her husband Tom, son
Stephen, and many wonderful friends.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring the life of Sheri Bohigian.
Sheri leaves behind a remarkable legacy of
love and selflessness. It is my honor to stand
with Sheri’s family in celebration of her great
life.

IN RECOGNITION OF MR. J. DAVID
KEANEY
HON. RICHARD E. NEAL
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, January 29, 2019
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I would like to
take this opportunity to congratulate J. David
Keaney on receiving career recognition by the
National Electrical Contractors Association
(‘‘NECA’’) and his retirement as Executive
Manager of the Western Massachusetts and
Central Massachusetts Chapters of NECA.
Dave Keaney grew up in Western Massa-
chusetts. He graduated from Cathedral High
School and attended American International
College in Springfield, Massachusetts obtain-
ing a bachelor’s degree in 1961 and master’s
degree in 1965. He went on to attend Western
New England College Law School and was a
member of the class of 1970. He was subse-
quently admitted to the Massachusetts Bar in
1972. His political relationship with Western
Massachusetts began with the friendship of
Mayor William Sullivan and culminated as
General Counsel for Sheriff Michael Ashe of
Hampden County. This relationship would
serve him well, leading him to work for the
Second Congressional District and the Hon.
Edward Patrick Boland, Jr. beginning on De-
cember 1, 1968. Dave would serve Congress-
man Boland for twenty years. He would go on
to serve in my Congressional office for the
next twelve years offering me unwavering ad-
vice on all matters affecting the constituency
of the district. His counsel in these areas was
uncompromising and steadfast.
Over Mr. Keaney’s 46 years of service to
NECA he has been essential to the harmony
of labor relations between electrical contrac-
tors and the International Brotherhood of Elec-
trical Workers (‘‘IBEW’’) in both Western and
Central Massachusetts. Dave has negotiated
dozens of labor agreements and resolved
labor disputes with the local IBEW unions,
both in Massachusetts and in Washington,
D.C., always in a professional manner aimed
at furthering the industry for the benefit of all.
Mr. Keaney has also chaired and served on
numerous committees focused on improving
the health and welfare of workers, pension
funds, and the training and education of elec-
tricians. He has assisted with the implementa-
tion of joint apprenticeship and training pro-
grams in Springfield and Worcester, estab-
lished to educate and train members of the
IBEW to become superior electricians and
leaders in the industry.
Madam Speaker, through his counsel, lead-
ership, and collegiality, Dave Keaney has as-
sisted contractors and electricians to bring
power, light, and communications technology
to Western and Central Massachusetts com-
munities; always leaving customers satisfied
with the work provided. Dave’s advice and
counsel to generations of electrical contractors
has enhanced the chapter’s market share,
provided impacted workplace safety and pro-
ductivity, and created mutually beneficial work-
ing conditions for electrical contractors and

INTRODUCTION OF CIVICS
LEARNING ACT OF 2019
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, January 29, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to introduce the Civics Learning Act of
2019, a bipartisan bill that focuses on increas-
ing civic participation by ensuring that young
people in our country receive a strong civics
education.
It might surprise you to learn that, according
to the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the
University of Pennsylvania, in 2018 only 32
percent of Americans surveyed were capable
of naming all three branches of government.
Only 30 percent of Americans surveyed knew
that the Senate is in charge of confirming Su-
preme Court nominees. In 2017, only 37 per-
cent of Americans surveyed could name any
of the rights guaranteed under the First
Amendment. In 2014, only 23 percent of
eighth graders performed at or above the pro-
ficient level on the National Assessment of
Educational Progress civics exam. This star-
tling reality makes it clear that civics education
in this country is in need of renewed focus.
Madam Speaker, the Civics Learning Act of
2019 promotes new and existing evidence-
based strategies to strengthen and prioritize
innovative civics learning and teaching by en-
couraging innovative American history, civics
and government, and geography instruction.
Professional development activities, pro-
graming, and learning strategies would also be
available to prepare teachers, principals, and
other school leaders. Such instruction and pro-
graming would particularly benefit low-income
students and underserved populations includ-
ing students and teachers at high-need
schools and low-access areas such as rural or
inner-city communities. Recognizing that most
civics programs focus on high school teachers
and students, this bill would ensure funding for
elementary, middle, and high school programs
in order to create a lasting foundation for civic
knowledge.
Madam Speaker, it is my sincere hope this
body will expeditiously pass this measure.
Doing so will reaffirm America’s commitment
to civics education, fostering a more informed
citizenship that will only strengthen our de-
mocracy.
HONORING THE LIFE AND MEM-
ORY OF DR. T. VAUGHN WALKER
HON. JOHN A. YARMUTH
OF KENTUCKY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, January 29, 2019
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I rise in
honor and in loving memory of Dr. Thomas
Vaughn Walker, who served not only his con-
gregation but the greater community of my
hometown of Louisville, the Commonwealth of
Kentucky, and more.
Dr. Walker spent his Sundays (and nearly
every other day of the week) sharing God’s
word from a brick building near the comer of
Seventh Street and Algonquin Parkway, where
First Gethsemane Baptist Church has proudly
stood since 1972. From March of 1984 on, Dr.
Walker made First ‘‘G’’ his home, serving as
its Senior Pastor for nearly 35 years.
Though he had a quiet and reserved de-
meanor, his words and his impact—from the
pulpit and beyond—were incredibly powerful.
When he spoke, you listened, and lives were
changed. Because Dr. Walker not only shared
the lessons of scripture, he also served as a
mentor and teacher for countless more.
The first black professor to work full-time at
a Southern Baptist Convention school, Dr.
Walker retired after 30 years of teaching at the
Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Lou-
isville. He earned a Ph.D. degree from Oregon
State University, a Master of Divinity and
Christian Education degree from the Southern
Baptist Theological Seminary, a Master of
Science degree from Eastern Illinois Univer-
sity, and a Bachelor of Science degree from
Hampton University. Education was an impor-
tant part of Dr. Walker’s faith, and he shared
that knowledge far and wide.
Dr. Walker’s family, including the love of his
life and his Hampton University college sweet-
heart, Dr. Cheryl D. Walker; their three chil-
dren, David, Mary, and Eryn; and their six
grandchildren, Celeste, Celvion, Jai, Joi, Jo-
siah, and Ella; will all remain in my continued
thoughts and prayers, along with the entire
church family of First Gethsemane Baptist.
Though his work on earth is now complete,
I am confident that his words and his teach-
ings will remain with so many of us, and will
be carried on by all of those who were lucky
enough to call him their friend and teacher.
I thank Dr. T. Vaughn Walker for a lifetime
of service.

IN RECOGNITION OF LEWISVILLE
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT LEADERS
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, January 29, 2019
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Lewisville High School stu-
dent leaders who have traveled to Wash-
ington, D.C. this week to study our nation’s
government. These twelve high school sen-
iors, under the leadership of Principal Jeffrey
Kajs, have continued Lewisville High School’s
strong legacy of leadership and service.
More than 60 years ago, the Lewisville High
School Class of 1958 traveled to the U.S.
Capitol for its senior class trip. Led by Senior
Class President R.L. Crawford, students met
with North Texas Congressman Frank Ikard in
April 1958.
Last summer, I had the privilege of joining
Lewisville High School students past and
present as members of the Class of 1958 pre-
sented a class photo with Congressman Ikard
to their alma mater. More than six decades
later, their service to the school is paying divi-
dends, particularly as the Class of 2019 fol-
lows in its footsteps.
The Lewisville High School Student Body
Officers of 2018–2019 include:
President—Braeden Kajs
Vice President—Jordan Jackman
Secretary—Brooke White
Treasurer—Matthew Jimenez
Parliamentarian—Cecil Ehirindu
Historian—Jackie Hernández
Community Service Officer—Yesenia
Regalado
LISD Liaison—Madison Jaegers
Multicultural Officer—Par Hniang
School Service Officer—Ariana Mata
School Service Officer—Danny Hair
Project Officer—Wesley Brewer
I appreciate these students’ dedication to
Lewisville High School and their North Texas
neighbors, and wish them the best as they
graduate this spring. Whether in six years or
six decades, it is my hope that the Class of
2019 will return to Lewisville High School to
continue this tradition for generations to come.

MSgt Slavin has shown not only outstanding
leadership, but uncommon technical skill. His
nine deployments in support of Operations
Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom dem-
onstrate tireless devotion and self-sacrifice on
behalf of the American people. He was a vital
part of joint exercises with allies around the
world, and volunteered to train members of
the Canadian Air Force and Indian Air Force
in the operation and maintenance of their
newly assigned C–130J aircraft. MSgt Slavin
also quickly volunteered to support disaster re-
lief efforts following Hurricane Katrina and the
2007 Peru Earthquake.
His numerous commendations and awards,
include the Air Force Commendation Medal,
National Defense Service Medal, Air Force
Outstanding Unit Award (w/2 Oak Leaf Clus-
ters), among several others, and are a testa-
ment to his steadfast courage, personal integ-
rity, unwavering work ethic, and impeccable
character. His enduring legacy of service to
our Nation is exceptional and sets the stand-
ard for all to follow.
On behalf of Pennsylvania’s Tenth Congres-
sional District, I commend and congratulate
my fellow brother-in-arms, Master Sergeant
Edward K. Slavin, upon his retirement and for
his devoted service to the United States of

IN RECOGNITION OF MR. TOMMY
LEONARD
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, January 29, 2019
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in recognition of the life of Tommy Leonard,
the founder of the Falmouth Road Race and
a beloved member of the Cape Cod commu-
nity.
Growing up in western Massachusetts, Mr.
Leonard fell in love with running at an early
age. Following high school, he joined the
United States Marines and ran his first Boston
Marathon in 1953.
Inspired by his community and Frank
Shorter’s historic victory in the marathon at the
1972 Olympics, Mr. Leonard brought his love
for running to Cape Cod. Thanks to his dedi-
cation, the Falmouth Road Race was first held
on August 15, 1973. Beyond the formation of
the race, Mr. Leonard worked tirelessly on the
ground level to promote the event and recruit
racers to inspire the next generation. Two
years later, the seven-mile race was won by
Frank Shorter.
What began as a fundraiser for the Fal-
mouth High School girl’s track team has now
taken on a life of its own. The race began with
just 92 runners working to fund travel ex-
penses for the Falmouth track team. However,
soon the race was helping local runners earn
college track scholarships. Now with over
12,000 annual racers, the Falmouth Road
Race has contributed millions of dollars to
local charities. Mr. Leonard has become a pil-
lar of his community and his dedication to
helping those around him continues to live on
with the Tommy Leonard Spotlight Award,
which gives $2,500 to a nonprofit each month.
Mr. Leonard passed away on January 16,
2019. However, his commitment will long be
remembered through his growing family of
runners and the legacy of his activism.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor the
life of Tommy Leonard. I ask that my col-
leagues join me in recognizing his many years
of dedication to his community.
