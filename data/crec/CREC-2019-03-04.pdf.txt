NOMINATION OF CHAD A. READLER
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this
week the Senate will vote on another
of President Trump’s hard-right judi-
cial nominees, Chad Readler, of the
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in Ohio.
Let me just say, anyone who thinks
the Republican Party has abandoned
their embrace of eliminating protec-
tions for preexisting conditions ought
to see how everyone votes on Chad
Readler. It will be a surprise to no one
that this nomination is proceeding
over the objection of Senator BROWN,
yet another example of Republicans
discarding the blue slip. Mr. Readler
stands out in his own way. A vote to
confirm this nomination is a vote to
end protections for Americans with
preexisting conditions.
Mr. Readler is behind the Trump ad-
ministration’s decision last year to
side with Texas and 19 other States
with Republican attorneys general
suing to repeal our healthcare law. Mr.
Readler was not just somebody who
worked on the case; he was the lead
lawyer, filing the Department of Jus-
tice brief declaring that the adminis-
tration refused to defend the laws of
our country.
In a brief so outlandish that career
Justice Department attorneys refused
to sign, Mr. Readler argued that pro-
tections for people with preexisting
conditions should be eliminated. Mark
my words. When this vote is cast, we
will see how every Republican feels
about preexisting conditions, their
protestations to the contrary.
Listen to this, folks. On the very
next day after the brief was submitted,
Mr. Readler was rewarded for his ef-
forts by President Trump with a nomi-
nation for a lifetime appointment. On
day one, Readler files the lead suit to
eliminate protections for those with
preexisting conditions, and on day two,
he is nominated to the bench—a life-
time appointment.
All 47 of us Senate Democrats are
united in opposing this nomination,
and we urge our Republican colleagues
who claim to support protections for
preexisting conditions to join us in vot-
ing to reject his nomination.
He is not just some lawyer who par-
ticipated. He is the chief cook and bot-
tle washer of the case that hurts hun-
dreds of millions of Americans. If you
have a daughter with cancer, and you
can’t get insurance, if you have a wife
or a husband who has a serious condi-
tion, and the insurance company pulls
back, you are losing your protection if
Readler has his way. Now he is going to
get on the bench with a lifetime ap-
pointment unless our Republican col-
leagues have the sense and the courage
to block him.
On this vote, every Republican will
be forced to show their constituents
and the American people whether they
stand for preexisting condition protec-
tions, for more Americans having
healthcare coverage, protecting Med-
icaid, and all insurance plans covering
maternity care and prescription drugs.
Having failed in Congress to repeal
these vital healthcare protections that
American families count on each day,
President Trump has turned to the
courts. The decision by Mr. Readler,
President Trump, and others in the
Trump administration to side with Re-
publican attorneys general who have
declared our healthcare law unconsti-
tutional is the latest example of the

President and Republicans trying to re-
peal our healthcare law.
The Texas lawsuit is working its way
through the courts now. If Mr. Re-
adler’s legal argument prevails in the
courts, access to healthcare for chil-
dren with asthma, adults with arthri-
tis, and cancer survivors would no
longer be guaranteed.
Mr. Readler argues that preexisting
condition protections like these are un-
constitutional. We Senate Democrats
think that is outrageous and extreme,
which is why we are calling on Repub-
licans to join us in opposing his nomi-
nation.
In short, any Republican Senator
who supports Mr. Readler’s nomination
is supporting the Trump Republican
lawsuit to get rid of preexisting condi-
tion protections and to take away
healthcare from tens of millions—if
not hundreds of millions—of Ameri-
cans.
DECLARATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY
Mr. President, now on the national
emergency, over the weekend, RAND
PAUL, the fourth Republican in the
Senate, announced his support for the
resolution to terminate the President’s
national emergency, giving it the need-
ed 51 votes to pass this Chamber.
It is clear that Members of both par-
ties know there is no actual emergency
at the border. The President himself
made clear, when announcing the state
of emergency, that he didn’t need to do
this. When the President says ‘‘I don’t
need to do this,’’ he is saying that
there is no emergency.
By definition, an emergency is some-
thing you need to do; it is an emer-
gency. In the President’s own words,
this is not an emergency. It is a polit-
ical bone and a face-saving device for
the President to throw to the right-
wing, to show he is still fighting for
the wall. It goes way beyond simply
how you feel on the wall, pro or con; it
goes to the fundamental building
blocks of how this country was struc-
tured.
Congress has the power of the purse.
Congress is a check on the Executive.
The Founding Fathers feared—prob-
ably above anything else, having dealt
with King George in the Revolution—
that an overreaching Executive was
one of the greatest dangers to our de-
mocracy. That is why so many Presi-
dents have respected and done emer-
gencies only in the rarest of times.
The last bunch of emergencies were
either a war, 9/11, Desert Storm, dis-
eases—real emergencies—things that
affect our climate, disasters such as
hurricanes and tornadoes, in terms of
what has happened with our weather
and our climate.
If this coequal branch of government
allows Presidents—whoever they may
be, Democrats or Republicans—to just
declare an emergency whenever they
want to achieve a partisan policy goal,
it will fundamentally alter the balance
of power in this country in a way the
Founding Fathers would be aghast at.
My guess is if George Washington,
Benjamin Franklin, or James Madison
were looking down on this Chamber,
they would want us to rise to the occa-
sion; that was the democracy they
wanted. I don’t know if we will.
The Founders of this Nation gave the
Congress one of the greatest powers
any government has—the power of the
purse. President Trump is trying to
take these powers away, even after
Congress rejected—explicitly rejected
several times—the money for his wall.
We Democrats know this, and now it
is clear that a growing number of Re-
publicans know it, as well: To allow
this emergency to persist is a change
in the fundamental, necessary, and
often exquisite balance of power that
marks the genius of the American Con-
stitution.
I know many of my friends on the
other side of the aisle understand that.
In fact, if you are a true conservative
and not just a Trump acolyte, you real-
ize that there shouldn’t be too much
power centralized in any place because
conservatism, at its root, believes in
maximizing the freedom of the indi-
vidual and minimizing anything that
encroaches on it, including an over-
reaching Executive. So to look the
other way because President Trump
wants this and because he is sometimes
almost in a temper tantrum about this
issue is so shortsighted and so detri-
mental to the long-term health, sta-
bility, and viability of how this balance
of power works.
Let us come together on this issue—
Democrats, Republicans, House and
Senate—and rise to the occasion. If
Congress stands up, it will be a reaffir-
mation of our democracy. It will be a
day historians will proudly note dec-
ades from now. It will be a reaffirma-
tion of the democracy the Founding
Fathers wanted.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. President, for decades, we have
known that climate change is not only
a major national challenge but an exis-
tential threat to our planet and to our
future.
Despite the gravity and scale of this
challenge, one political party in the
United States—the Republican Party—
has largely denied the problem even ex-
ists, denied the overwhelming con-
sensus of the scientific community,
and denied most attempts in Congress
to tackle climate change.
Today marks day 18 since I first chal-
lenged our Republican leader and all of
my Republican colleagues to answer
these three questions: One, is climate
change real? Two, is it caused by
human activity? And, three, should
Congress act immediately, strongly, to
deal with this issue?
We haven’t heard an answer from the
leader or from almost every Repub-
lican in this body. So let me repeat
them again.
Leader MCCONNELL, do you believe
that climate change is real? Leader
MCCONNELL, do you believe that it is
caused by human activity? Leader
MCCONNELL, do you believe that Con-
gress should take immediate action to
address the crisis of climate change?
I suppose it is not a surprise that Re-
publicans are fearful to answer these
questions. They know the public is on
our side on this issue, overwhelmingly
two to one. But the oil industry, which
funnels tons of money into Republican
coffers, much of it dark money, undis-
closed—they are on the other side.
That is why they are afraid to answer
the question one way or the other.
Today’s Washington Post details how
the denial of basic scientific facts sur-
rounding climate change is amounting
to a political litmus test for President
Trump. Perhaps Republicans are avoid-
ing answering questions I have posed
for fear that the President would re-
taliate for siding against him and his
radical views. There is no real, rational
explanation.
U.S.-CHINA TRADE NEGOTIATIONS
Mr. President, finally, on China
trade, we have seen reports in today’s
newspapers that President Trump is
close to cutting a deal with China.
I have given the President credit for
bringing China to the table with his
strong action on tariffs. He has done
more to stop China from stealing our
intellectual property and keeping
American businesses out, causing tens
of millions of Americans to lose in-
come and millions of Americans to lose
jobs. He has done more than previous
Presidents. I give him credit.
But if now—at the end of the day—he
sells out, backs out, and just looks at
trade balances and doesn’t deal with
the fundamental, structural ways
China takes advantage of us, it doesn’t
matter that he put in the tariffs in the
first place.
The bottom line is very simple: China
is our economic rival, and they don’t
play by the rules. They steal intellec-
tual property by cyber theft, even
promising that they will not. They
don’t let American companies come in
and compete fairly in China, even
though their companies can come here.
My late father-in-law, a cabdriver in
New York City, just like one of those
Damon Runyon cabdrivers, said that
when it comes to certain things, Amer-
ica is not Uncle Sam; we are ‘‘Uncle
Sap.’’ When it comes to China, that is
what we are. We have let them take ad-
vantage of us for two decades—two dec-
ades.
Now President Trump has the oppor-
tunity to stop them, and the news re-
ports today say that he is going to
back off—back off—because China will
buy some more product.
China’s buying more products will
not change the structural problems. It
will not change the basic erosion of
American wealth and jobs as it flows to
China. It is a temporary salve and
nothing more.
I care about our farmers; we have a
lot of them in New York State. I care
about companies that might be hurt in
the short run by this, but unless we
take some tough action against China,
the hurt will be much greater and
much longer.
I say to President Trump: You stayed
tough in North Korea, and it inured to

your benefit. The Democratic leader of
the Senate praised President Trump for
doing that. Stay tough on China. When
it comes to China, don’t let March be
the month when it is said that Presi-
dent Trump went in like a lion and
went out like a lamb, and President Xi,
a darn good negotiator, figuratively
eats our lunch.
There is a generational imperative to
get this right. The President and his
folks must not squander the chance to
achieve permanent reforms to China’s
economic relations with the world.
This chance will not come around
again for a long time, and American
wealth, income, and jobs will ebb. This
is one of the most important moments
in the Trump Presidency.
President Trump, stand tough. China
can no longer be allowed to take ad-
vantage of us.

TORNADOES IN ALABAMA AND GEORGIA
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I
know the entire Senate joins me today
in offering deep sympathies to the
communities affected by yesterday’s
spate of tornadoes in east Alabama and
Georgia. As first responders continue
to search for survivors in the rubble,
we know that at least 23 innocent lives
were lost to this disaster all in Lee
County, AL. Our condolences are espe-
cially with their loved ones, and our
gratitude is with the emergency per-
sonnel and local officials who spear-
headed evacuation and rescue efforts.
The people of Alabama are all too fa-
miliar with the pain caused by dev-
astating storms like yesterday’s. The
entire region has been hit hard in re-
cent years, seemingly by one disaster
after another. They continue to brace
against the threat of tornadoes and the
flooding that so often impacts commu-
nities in my State of Kentucky.
At every step of the way—from re-
sponse and recovery to resilient
achievement—Alabama has benefitted
from the devoted leadership of Senator
RICHARD SHELBY. On the specific issue
of disaster recovery, his hard work and
steady hand have helped to lead the
charge. When supplemental funding for
natural disaster relief receives floor
time here in the Senate, it will be
thanks to the hard work of our col-
leagues like Senator PERDUE, Senator
ISAKSON, and others, and, certainly,
Chairman SHELBY.
Of course, this is far from the only
area in which RICHARD SHELBY has de-
livered results for his State and for our
Nation. For years, he has made a per-
sonal mission out of restoring and im-
proving our Nation’s infrastructure. He
has brought wise and decisive leader-
ship as our chief appropriator, and the
State of Alabama bears countless signs
of Senator SHELBY’s dedicated serv-
ice—from supporting the missile de-
fense and space exploration programs
in Huntsville to helping to establish
the National Water Center in Tusca-
loosa, where researchers forecast floods
and work to mitigate water-related
hazards.
It is fitting today to praise Senator
SHELBY’s continued service. It also
happened that, over the weekend, the
senior Senator from Alabama became
the longest serving senator in the his-
tory of his State. I couldn’t be happier
to recognize my friend RICHARD SHELBY
on this occasion, and I know each of
our colleagues will join me in con-
gratulating him on the years of faith-
ful service to Alabamians that have
made this recognition possible.
NOMINATIONS
Mr. President, on an entirely dif-
ferent matter, this week the Senate is
considering the nominations of three
more well-qualified jurists to vacancies
on our Nation’s Federal courts.
First is Allison Jones Rushing, of
North Carolina, to serve on the Fourth
Circuit. Ms. Rushing is a graduate of
Wake Forest University and Duke Uni-
versity School of Law with high hon-
ors. In the years since, she has built a
distinguished record in private practice
and has held prestigious appellate
clerkships on two Federal circuit
courts and the U.S. Supreme Court.
I will have more to say on the state
of our nominations process soon, but I
hope each of our colleagues will begin
the week by joining me in voting to ad-
vance Ms. Rushing’s nomination later
today.
THE GREEN NEW DEAL
Mr. President, on one final matter,
like many Americans, I have spent the
past several weeks watching with in-
terest as prominent leaders in the
Democratic Party have engaged in a
political footrace. They are sprinting—
literally, sprinting—as far left as pos-
sible, as quickly as possible, trying to
outdo one another. The result is that
one of our two major political parties
has begun embracing one radical, half-
baked socialist proposal after another.
It is really a sight to see.
First came the Democratic Politician
Protection Act, a sweeping Wash-
ington, DC, takeover of what Ameri-
cans can say about politics and how
they elect their representatives.
Speaker PELOSI and her House col-
leagues were ready with that from day
one in this new Congress. They chose it
as their No. 1 ceremonial first bill of
the year, H.R. 1. Let me say that this
is quite a piece of legislation to hold up
as the defining product—bear in mind,
the defining product—of a new Demo-
cratic House majority.
House Democrats are championing an
unprecedented takeover of our Nation’s
electoral system—one that would over-
haul campaign rules and make it hard-
er for private citizens to exercise their
right to political speech.
It would replace private money in po-
litical campaigns with your tax dol-
lars. Let me say that again. They take
your private money contributed to a
candidate of your choice out of the po-
litical process and replace that with
your tax dollars—up to $5 million to
any candidate that wants it—even, by
the way, if it happens to be a candidate
you disagree with. They are going to
take your tax money and give it to
candidates you don’t agree with and
swing the partisan balance of the Fed-
eral Election Commission, which has
the final say in election regulations.
Oh, and it all comes under the guise
of—you guessed it—this is about re-
storing democracy. Now, of course, this
sprawling 622-page doorstop is never
going to become law. I certainly don’t
plan to even bring it to the floor here
in the Senate. There are always im-
provements and reforms to be made,
but this certainly isn’t it.
It does give us a useful signal of our
Democratic colleagues’ real goals—
what they really want to do. Demo-
crats look out over the landscape of
America today, and everywhere they
look, they see opportunity to seize
money and power from American fami-
lies and communities and pile it up in
their own hands—you guessed it—right
here in Washington. Taxing more,
spending more, and Washington’s seiz-
ing more power away from the people—
that is the Democrat’s hammer of
choice. In every part of American life,
they see a nail. In every part of Amer-
ican life, they see a nail.
Just look at the Green New Deal.
From what we understand, the Amer-
ican people can expect a government-
mandated overhaul of every four-
walled structure in America—a govern-
ment-mandated overhaul of every four-
walled structure in America—and, if
that were not enough, an end to Amer-
ican fossil fuel and energy production
from nuclear powerplants—of course,
along with all the jobs that make both
of those possible.
According to background documents,
there are plans for a government-guar-
anteed income. Listen to this: a gov-
ernment-guaranteed income for those
unwilling to work, all at the low price
of an estimated—listen to this—$93
trillion.
Of course, next came the massive
one-size-fits-all government-run
healthcare proposal—‘‘Medicare for
none.’’ It strips everything from our
seniors’ Medicare Program but the
name. It slaps that name on a new gov-
ernment-run plan, and they are so con-
fident Americans will love their Demo-
cratic-designed insurance that they
feel the need to outlaw competing pri-
vate insurance altogether, just to
make sure there is no competition.
Democrats want to strip existing
health plans away from middle-class
families, even if they are happy with
their current coverage, and, inevitably,

hike taxes on those very families to

As I have said, none of these things
Democrats have pulled off their far-left
wish list have a chance of becoming
law in 2019. A lot of it almost sounds
like standup comedy, but the under-
lying philosophy that all of this rep-
resents is no laughing matter whatso-

DECLARATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, despite
what you hear inside the beltway, the
challenges along our southwest border
are real, and the people of Texas feel
that impact every day along the 1,200-
mile common border we have with
Mexico.
Last week, for example, the Border
Patrol in the Rio Grande Valley Sector
arrested 1,300 illegal immigrants in a
single day—the second time in 2 weeks
they exceeded that number. In the
same time period, the Laredo port of
entry seized $2.3 million worth of co-
caine and marijuana. Sadly, a father
and son traveling from Guatemala
nearly drowned while attempting to
cross the Rio Grande but were saved
thanks to the efforts of the Border Pa-
trol. In a small town just north of
Eagle Pass, a group of 90 undocu-
mented immigrants—many of whom
were women and children between the
ages of 1 and 17—were apprehended
after crossing the Rio Grande River.
That was all in Texas last week.
Last year alone, 400,000 people were
detained coming across our south-
western border—400,000. Tens of thou-
sands of unaccompanied children and
family units were detained as well.
These stories have become so com-
mon, somehow we have become anes-
thetized to the human emergency and
crisis occurring along the border.
Frankly, I do not understand why our
Democratic friends have become com-
pletely apathetic when it comes to bor-
der security or dealing with what
President Obama himself called a hu-
manitarian crisis.
A few weeks ago, we know President
Trump declared a national emergency
over this crisis, which would allow
some funding to be shifted from other
areas to support our Border Patrol mis-
sions. This decision was met with a
great deal of pushback, some of which
I believe is warranted and some of
which I believe is not. I would like to
explain what I think is warranted and
what I think is not.
For those, like some of our col-
leagues across the Capitol, including
some of the Texas Democratic delega-
tion—they call this a fake emergency.
I couldn’t disagree more. Just ask the
folks who live along the border and
deal with this each day. The scenes I
describe are not isolated incidents;
they are happening daily, weekly,
monthly, and at a scale and volume
that, frankly, are overwhelming the
ability of officials and people along the
border to deal with.
Let’s rewind to 2014. I alluded to this
a moment ago. When President Obama
was President, we saw an unprece-
dented number of Central Americans
coming across the border claiming asy-
lum. That year, 68,000 family units
were apprehended at the southern bor-
der—‘‘family units’’ meaning at least
one adult and at least one child. That
is what President Obama called a hu-
manitarian crisis.
Today, not much has changed except
for the numbers, and it has gotten
worse, not better. In the last 4 months
alone, there have been nearly 100,000
family units apprehended at the bor-
der. These are people arriving en masse
by the thousands, sometimes called a
caravan. We know there are dangerous
drugs that come in at the same time
every day, young women and children
are being trafficked into sex slavery,
and migrants are being abandoned by
coyotes and left to die in the desert.
So I don’t see a lot of difference be-
tween what President Obama called a
humanitarian crisis in 2014 and what
President Trump in 2019 calls an emer-
gency.
While I agree that there is a crisis at
our border and that more needs to be
done, I have been consistent in my con-
cerns about the means by which this
funding is being provided.
This whole episode is completely con-
trived by the fact that the Speaker of
the House, Ms. PELOSI—despite the fact
that we had bipartisan support for the
Secure Fence Act in 2006 and 2008, she
all of a sudden decided, because the
politics suited her, that building any
additional physical barrier was im-
moral. The Democratic leader here in
the Senate said that not one dollar was
going to be spent for physical barriers
along the border. We saw an impasse
that resulted in the Federal Govern-
ment or at least 25 percent of the gov-
ernment being shut down for 35 days.
This was completely unnecessary and
contrived. This was all about politics
and certainly not about trying to find
solutions to the problem.
I have said before and I will say again
that where we are now was not any-
body’s first choice—certainly not mine.
We know that many legitimate con-
cerns have been raised about the clear
definitions of the role of the legislative
and executive branches. It is clear
under the separation of powers that
Congress holds the checkbook. No mat-
ter who the President is or what they
want funding for, it must be authorized
by Congress. But when Democrats
refuse to engage in a problem-solving
process, as they have done over the last
few months, it makes things much
more complicated.
We heard the Speaker of the House,
as I said, refuse to provide more than
one dollar for border security. The mi-
nority leader said that no additional
money would be provided for barriers.
The reason they made these state-
ments isn’t because Democrats are all
of a sudden opposed to improved border
security. As we have seen in the past,
Democrats have supported those phys-
ical barriers. In 2006, the Democratic
leader himself and a number of our cur-
rent colleagues and then-colleagues,
such as Hillary Clinton and Barack
Obama, supported the Secure Fence
Act, but today, somehow things are dif-
ferent.
Democrats refuse to come to the ne-
gotiating table, not because they are
against border security, presumably,
but because their political base dis-
likes the man sitting behind the Reso-
lute Desk. This is not about the facts
or the problem presented; this is about
whether President Trump will be de-
feated in his attempts to get additional
money for border security. As the
President found out, it is pretty tough
to find a compromise when your nego-
tiating partners—the Speaker and the
Democratic leader of the Senate—
refuse to come to the table at all. So
the President found himself negoti-
ating against himself.
I believe the regular appropriations
process should always be the approved
method, but, of course, Congress—and
this should be a wake-up call to each of
us—Congress has approved emergency
powers as an exception to the normal
process by which money is appro-
priated.
While some are trying to make this
seem like a constitutional crisis and
some groundbreaking breach of power
by President Trump, I don’t believe
that is true, because he is using the
power that was delegated to the execu-
tive branch by Congress. In other
words, he is not making this up out of
whole cloth, like President Obama did
when he provided deferred action for
childhood arrivals. He said more than
20 times that he didn’t have authority
to do it, that there was no statute to
authorize it, but he did it anyway. It
continues to be litigated—now up to
the Supreme Court of the United
States.
Here is what I found when this con-
troversy arose, when we did some re-
search. We found that Congress has
granted the Presidency emergency
powers under 123 statutes. This marks
the 60th time the emergency powers
have been invoked under the National
Emergencies Act since 1978. So Con-
gress is responsible for providing this
exception to the normal appropriations
process. Congress has done that 123
times, and Presidents have used those
powers 60 times. That ought to put
what is happening today in some larger
context. Previous Presidents have used
them for things like prohibiting the
importation of blood diamonds from
Sierra Leone or prohibiting new invest-
ment in Burma.
Because the President’s emergency
declaration fits into the confines of the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1613
March 4, 2019
authorities Congress has given him,
this is not a constitutional crisis, in
my view, as some people are painting it
to be, but I am concerned about the
process for a few reasons.
One, as a number of our colleagues
have pointed out over the last few
weeks, it does set a precedent. A use of
these powers in circumstances under
which a conference committee has al-
ready come up with a dollar amount
for border security that was ultimately
signed by the President and he declared
a national emergency on top of that in
order to gain access to additional
money—I do worry that this sets a
precedent whereby a future President
could abuse this authority.
These 123 congressional grants of au-
thority to Presidents—any President—
are broad, and they cover everything
from the military, to public health, to
Federal pay schedules. Some are pretty
unremarkable, such as the one that al-
lows the Secretary of Transportation
to waive vehicle weight limits on a
stretch of Interstate 95 in Maine. That
is one of the congressional delegations
of authority. Others are more alarm-
ing, such as the one that would author-
ize the President to suspend a law pro-
hibiting the testing of chemical and bi-
ological weapons on human subjects.
What I find most concerning is that
the definition of an ‘‘emergency’’ is
very vague and subjective, which
means it is going to end up being the
subject of litigation. Yes, lawsuits have
already been filed in the Federal dis-
trict court challenging this declaration
of an emergency under these cir-
cumstances. This gets to my basic
problem, which is that this is not a
very productive way to actually ac-
complish the goal if you know that
what you are going to do is going to be
tied up in litigation for the next 6
months or a year.
But I have to ask the question: Under
these broad grants of authority that
Congress has previously given to a
President or any President, what would
stop a future President from declaring
a national emergency over climate
change or global warming? I am con-
cerned that we are going to see these
emergency powers used as a failsafe for
policies favored by the Executive—one
who takes it further for a purely ideo-
logical goal that in no way comes close
to a crisis or emergency.
Yes, I also worry that some of the
money that will be accessed under this
declaration of national emergency is
for military construction projects,
many of which are located at military
bases in Texas. This is not a case of, do
we need border security, or do we need
to provide the housing and infrastruc-
ture for our military—we need both. So
the President and Congress should not
try to rob from Peter to pay Paul.
I, along with my colleagues, have
fought for these appropriations for
military construction because they are
important to the ability to recruit and
retain men and women who volunteer
for the military, and their families.
They are important for our national se-
curity. I have and I will continue to
push the administration to not let
these critical projects get caught in
the crosshairs in this dispute over ade-
quate border security funds.
Third and finally, I suggest that Con-
gress needs to look in the mirror when
it comes to the situation in which we
find ourselves. The only reason Presi-
dent Trump had the authority to do
what he did is because Congress dele-
gated it to him, just like it is delegated
to future Presidents and has been to
past Presidents under these 123 sepa-
rate grants of authority. I worry that
Congress has delegated too much of its
power to the executive branch.
In the 1944 case Korematsu v. United
States, the Supreme Court upheld the
internment of Japanese Americans—
something unimaginable today, but in
1944, during the throes of the Second
World War, it was something that was
the official policy of the government.
It went all the way to the Supreme
Court of the United States. Justice
Robert Jackson—one of the three dis-
senters—said that each emergency
power ‘‘lies about like a loaded weapon,
ready for the hand of any authority
that can bring forward a plausible
claim of an urgent need.’’ I agree with
Justice Jackson’s warning.
If our Democratic colleagues are con-
cerned about how this President or any
other President will utilize the powers
this body has given him, perhaps we
should reexamine those powers rather
than fault the President for using au-
thorities Congress has already given to
him.
Despite these concerns, I believe the
President is operating within the au-
thority Congress has delegated to him.
It is strictly because of the dysfunction
in the Congress and our inability to
work together to come up with solu-
tions when it comes to border security
or immigration that the President is
desperate to find access to the funds he
believes are necessary for the national
security of our country.
As I said, I think this situation re-
flects more on the dysfunction in
Washington these days and the inabil-
ity of Congress to work with the Presi-
dent to find bipartisan, commonsense
solutions. I think we ought to return to
those bipartisan, commonsense solu-
tions rather than engage in some of the
drama associated with this particular
declaration under these sets of cir-
cumstances.

DECLARATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President,
on Thursday, I suggested that Presi-
dent Trump has sufficient congres-
sional authority to spend the $5.7 bil-
lion he asked for in his January 6 let-
ter to the Senate Appropriations Com-
mittee chairman to build 234 miles of
border wall without resort to a dan-
gerous national emergency precedent
that could upset the constitutional
separation of powers that goes to the
heart of our freedom.
I believe the President has clear au-
thority to transfer up to $4 billion
among accounts within the over $600
billion defense budget in order to
counter drug activities and to block
drug smuggling corridors across inter-
national borders.
On February 15, the President said
that he plans to use $2.5 billion of this
same transfer authority to build the
234 miles of wall along the southern
border that he asked for in his January
6 letter. If he increases the transfer
from $2.5 billion to $3.7 billion, along
with the other existing funding author-
ity that he has, he will have the full
$5.7 billion that he said he needed.
William E. Nelson, of New York Uni-
versity School of Law—one of Amer-
ica’s foremost scholars of legal his-
tory—wrote an excellent op-ed last
week that explained why it is so impor-
tant that the President and the Con-
gress should not, in Professor Nelson’s
words, ‘‘invert the entire constitu-
tional order where Congress appro-
priates and the President spends.’’
I ask unanimous consent that Pro-
fessor Nelson’s article be printed in the

There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

THE CONVERSATION: TRUMP VS. CONGRESS:
THE EMERGENCY DECLARATION SHOULD NOT
BE RESOLVED IN COURT
(Oped by: William E. Nelson, New York
University February 28, 2019)
President Donald Trump’s emergency dec-
laration to build a border wall has provoked
a constitutional confrontation with Con-
gress.
Here is the background for understanding
what’s at stake—beginning more than two
centuries ago.
A major problem for the framers at the
Constitutional Convention in 1787 was how
to create a presidency powerful enough to
protect the nation, yet constrained enough
to prevent a president from becoming a dic-
tator.
Ultimately, the president was given power
to enforce the law, conduct foreign relations
and command the armed forces. Congress re-
tained most other key powers, including the
power of the purse and the power to declare
war.
The framers knew they could not predict
all that the future would bring. So they left
the precise boundaries between presidential
and congressional power unclear. This impre-
cision in our checks and balances has served
the nation well for 230 years because it pro-
vides the flexibility to govern while pre-
venting tyranny.
As scholars of constitutional law and his-
tory, we believe that President Trump’s as-
sertion of a national emergency to build a
wall along the Mexican border and the law-
suits filed in response together threaten the
very imprecision that has helped maintain
constitutional checks and balances for more
than two centuries.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1614 March 4, 2019
To best maintain that balance, this con-
frontation should be resolved in the political
realm, not in the courts.
THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY
But the lawsuits over the emergency dec-
laration will probably reach the Supreme
Court, and the court might well hold
Trump’s emergency declaration unconstitu-
tional.
That would set a precedent that would un-
duly limit national emergency power that
some future president may need.
Alternatively, the court could decide the
lawsuits in Trump’s favor. That would invert
the entire constitutional order, where Con-
gress appropriates and the president spends.
It would undercut the checks and balances
provided by the framers and lead to an in-
credibly powerful presidency.
Either result the court reaches would set a
bad precedent.
Congress can avert this problem.
The 1976 National Emergencies Act gives
Congress power to invalidate a president’s
declaration of emergency by a resolution
passed by simple majorities of both houses.
The House voted 245–182 on Tuesday to
overturn President Trump’s national emer-
gency declaration. Democrats were joined by
more than a dozen Republicans in the vote.
The Senate will now take up the measure,
though a vote has not been scheduled.
White House adviser Stephen Miller has al-
ready suggested that Trump would veto any
such resolution.
‘‘He’s going to protect his national emer-
gency declaration. Guaranteed,’’ Miller said
on Fox News. Both the House and the Senate
would then need two-thirds majorities to
override his veto.
We believe that for Congress to protect the
constitutional order, its members must mus-
ter the necessary two-thirds majority.
TO THE COURT
If Congress does not override the presi-
dent’s veto, the lawsuits will probably go to
the Supreme Court. The court’s decision has
strong potential to do harm to the historic
constitutional balance.
That balance was upheld by the Supreme
Court in a crucial decision more than 50
years ago.
On April 9, 1952, President Truman de-
clared a national emergency. In the midst of
the Korean War, he seized the country’s steel
mills on the eve of a nationwide strike be-
cause steel was necessary to make weapons.
weapons. The steel companies immediately
brought a lawsuit against the seizure in fed-
eral court.
Recognizing the importance of the issue,
the Supreme Court heard arguments on May
12, and handed down its decision on June 2.
The court, in Youngstown Company v.
Sawyer, rejected the president’s claim by a
6–3 majority.
Justice Robert Jackson wrote an opinion
proclaiming a general approach to the bal-
ance of powers between Congress and the
president, rather than a fixed rule.
Jackson declared that ‘‘when the President
acts pursuant to an express or implied au-
thorization of Congress, his authority is at
its maximum.’’
The president’s power, Jackson wrote, is in
a ‘‘zone of twilight’’ when Congress has not
spoken. When ‘‘the President takes measures
incompatible with the expressed or implied
will of Congress, his power is at its lowest
ebb.’’
PRESIDENT AGAINST CONGRESS
President Trump is acting contrary to
Congress’s will by appropriating money Con-
gress has refused to appropriate. He signed a
carefully constructed compromise budget
bill passed by more than veto-proof two-
thirds majorities in both houses. He accepted
the U.S. $1.375 billion that the bill gave him
for a border wall.
He then broke the deal by declaring a na-
tional emergency to allocate an additional
$6.7 billion to pay for border wall construc-
tion.
In two important cases, the Supreme Court
has broadly prohibited Congress from giving
any of its appropriations authority or re-
sponsibility to the president—even volun-
tarily.
Congress’s adoption of a joint resolution
seeking to invalidate Trump’s emergency
declaration—an explicit statement of con-
gressional will—would provide conclusive
evidence that would only strengthen the ar-
gument that the president is acting contrary
to Congress’s will.
PRESERVING THE CONSTITUTIONAL BALANCE
If the case gets to the Supreme Court, the
president’s lawyers might argue that for
Congress to decisively oppose an emergency
declaration of the president, lawmakers
must override his veto by a two-thirds vote.
Imposing such a veto override require-
ment, however, would eliminate the court’s
role. That’s because a presidential declara-
tion of emergency is immediately invalid if
Congress overrides a presidential veto.
Two-thirds overrides are historically un-
likely by Congress. And requiring a two-
thirds vote would give a president who de-
clares a national emergency virtually unlim-
ited power to appropriate money to his or
her heart’s content—perhaps hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars to address, for example, cli-
mate change by subsidizing construction of
wind farms.
Requiring Congress to override a presi-
dential veto that protects a presidential ap-
propriation would turn the appropriations
power and the Constitution’s checks and bal-
ances inside out.
Congress has already spoken through pass-
ing the spending bill and will be considering
a resolution to invalidate the president’s
declaration of emergency.
Such a resolution, even if vetoed by the
president, places President Trump’s declara-
tion in Justice Jackson’s category where
presidential power ‘‘is at its lowest ebb.’’
It also preserves the historic flexibility by
allowing the court’s decision to give def-
erence to the votes of Congress in cases of
claimed emergencies.
This story has been updated to reflect the
House vote on Feb. 26, 2019, on the resolution
to overturn President Trump’s national
emergency declaration.

REMEMBERING BORIS NEMTSOV
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, on
Sunday, February 24, thousands of peo-
ple marched in Moscow and in cities
across Russia to remember Boris
Nemtsov, a Russian statesman and
friend of freedom who was gunned down
in sight of the Kremlin walls 4 years
ago.
These people were honoring a Rus-
sian patriot who stood for a better fu-
ture—a man who, after leaving the pin-
nacle of government, chose a coura-
geous path of service to his country
and his fellow Russians. Boris Nemtsov
was a man who walked the walk. When
others were silent out of fear or com-
plicity, he stood up for a future in
which the Russian people need not risk
jail or worse for simply wanting a say
in how their country is run.
Sadly, since Mr. Nemtsov’s assassina-
tion, the risks of standing up for what
is right have grown in Russia. With
every passing month, ordinary citizens
there become political prisoners for
doing what we take for granted here in
the United States—associating with a
political cause or worshipping God ac-
cording to the dictates of one’s con-
science.
Last month alone, in a high-profile
case, a mother was jailed for the crime
of being a political activist in Russia.
She was kept from caring for her criti-
cally ill daughter until just hours be-
fore her daughter died. Jehovah’s Wit-
nesses have been sentenced to years be-
hind bars for practicing their faith.
Also, a leader of a small anti-corrup-
tion organization was beaten to death
with metal rods on the outskirts of
Moscow. This was all just in February,
and it is not even a comprehensive ac-
count of the Russian state’s using its
powers not against real enemies but
against its own people—peaceful citi-
zens doing what peaceful citizens do.
As for the Nemtsov assassination, 4
years later, justice has yet to be
served. It appears that President Putin
and his cronies have little interest in
uncovering and punishing the master-
minds behind Russia’s highest profile
killing in recent memory. While a few
perpetrators who had been linked to
the Kremlin-appointed leader of
Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, were con-
victed and sent to prison, Mr.
Nemtsov’s family, friends, and legal
team believe the organizers of his mur-
der remain unidentified and at large.
I understand that Russia’s top inves-
tigative official has prevented his sub-
ordinates from indicting a close
Kadyrov associate, Major Ruslan
Geremeyev, as an organizer in the as-
sassination, and the information link-
ing Geremeyev to Mr. Nemtsov’s mur-
der was credible enough for a NATO
ally to place Geremeyev on its sanc-
tions list. Yet there has still been no
indictment. Russian security services
continue to forbid the release of foot-
age from cameras at the site of the as-
sassination. Russian legal authorities
refuse to classify the assassination of a
prominent opposition leader and
former First Deputy Prime Minister as
a political crime. Despite all of this,
they have declared the case solved.
Given this pattern of deliberate inac-
tion on the part of Russian authorities,
the need for some accountability out-
side of Russia has grown more urgent.
Russia and the United States are par-
ticipating states in the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Eu-
rope, or the OSCE, and have agreed

that matters of justice and human
rights are of enough importance to be
of legitimate interest to other member
states. Respect for these principles in-
side a country is often a predictor of
the country’s external behavior. So
countries such as ours have a reason to
be involved.
At the recent meeting of the OSCE’s
Parliamentary Assembly, we began a
formal inquiry into Mr. Nemtsov’s un-
solved murder and have appointed a
rapporteur to review and report on the
circumstances of the Nemtsov assas-
sination as well as on the progress of
the Russian investigation. As the chair
of the U.S. delegation to the OSCE Par-
liamentary Assembly, I supported this
process from its conception at an event
I cohosted last July in Berlin.
Yet, as the United States of America,
there is more we can do. To that end, I
am glad to cosponsor a resolution with
my Senate colleagues that calls on our
own government to report back to Con-
gress on what we know of the cir-
cumstances around Boris Nemtsov’s
murder. This resolution also calls on
the Treasury Department to use tools
like the Magnitsky Act to sanction in-
dividuals who have been linked to this
brutal murder, such as Ruslan
Geremeyev.
We hear constantly from Russian op-
position figures and civic activists that
personal sanctions, such as those im-
posed by the Magnitsky Act, have a de-
terrent effect. Vladimir Putin has
made it abundantly clear that these
sanctions, based on personal account-
ability, are more of a threat to his re-
gime than blunter tools, such as sec-
toral sanctions, that often feed his
propaganda and end up harming the
same people we are trying to help in
Russia—innocent citizens. To its cred-
it, the Trump administration has done
a better job than had the previous ad-
ministration in its implementing of
the new mandates and powers Congress
authorized in both the Russia and
Global Magnitsky Acts. We are in a
much different place than we were
when these tools were originally envis-
aged nearly 10 years ago.
The administration is mandated to
update the Magnitsky Act’s list annu-
ally, with there being a deadline in De-
cember that sometimes slips into Janu-
ary. Now it is already March, and we
have yet to see any new designations
under the law that the late Mr.
Nemtsov himself called the most pro-
Russian law ever adopted in a foreign
legislature. While the law has been
lauded by Russian democrats, it is
rightly despised by those like Vladimir
Putin who abuse and steal from the
American people.
Recall that it was at the Helsinki
summit late last summer between the
leaders of Russia and the United States
of America—perhaps the grandest stage
in U.S.-Russian relations in a decade—
where Mr. Putin himself requested that
his investigators be able to depose U.S.
officials most closely associated with
passing and implementing the
Magnitsky law, as if they were crimi-
nals.
We need to show the Russian dictator
that this sort of bullying will not stand
and that we will continue to imple-
ment the Magnitsky Act thoroughly
and fairly.
A year ago, I participated—along
with many of my colleagues in the
House and Senate—in the unveiling of
Boris Nemtsov Plaza in front of the
Russian Embassy here in Washington,
DC—the first official memorial to
Boris Nemtsov anywhere in the world.
One day, I hope there will be memo-
rials to Boris Nemtsov all across Rus-
sia, but the best tribute to his memory
will be a Russia he wanted to see, a
just and prosperous Russia, at peace
with its neighbors and a partner with
the United States.

UKRAINE
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I rise to
speak on Russia’s ongoing and illegal
occupation of Ukraine.
Two weeks ago, I had the opportunity
to travel to Ukraine where I saw first-
hand the effects of nearly 5 years of
Russian occupation, aggression, and
hostilities suffered by the Ukrainian
people.
Since Russia’s illegal seizure of Cri-
mea in March of 2014 and their subse-
quent invasion of eastern Ukraine’s
Donbas region the following month,
over 10,000—10,000—people have been
killed and many more have been
wounded or displaced in the fighting.
Hiding behind so-called pro-Russian
separatists in eastern Ukraine, the re-
gime of Vladimir Putin has indiscrimi-
nately targeted both civilian and mili-
tary targets, across the line of contact,
in flagrant violation of the Minsk
ceasefire and the law of war. In fact,
shelling was occurring just 1 day prior
to my visit to the Eastern Front.
The Eastern Front, even saying it
now, before my colleagues in the Sen-
ate, the phrase seems almost surreal
and harkens back to a bygone era in
which the Cold War dominated our po-
litical landscape.
The first time I visited Ukraine was
in 1989—1989—as part of an agricultural
exchange program. The Soviet Union
was on the verge of collapse, and the
spirit of independence, freedom, and
self-determination was gaining steam.
My gracious Ukrainian hosts didn’t
want to discuss farming. It was an ag-
ricultural exchange, but they didn’t
want to discuss farming. They wanted
to know what it was like to be an
American. They wanted to know what
it was like to have freedom and be
independent.
Just like the oppressive yoke of
authoritarianism dominated Ukraine
in 1989, it once again threatens a people
who have fought hard to create a na-
tion of laws accountable to its people
and as champions of human dignity,
free markets, and democratic values.
With our help, Ukraine has managed to
hold the line against the Russian ag-
gressors. Our security assistance, in
the form of intelligence-sharing, spe-
cial operations capacity-building, and,
most recently, the delivery of Javelin
anti-tank weapons, has enabled the
Ukrainian Armed Forces to deter fur-
ther Russian advances into free
Ukraine and has caused the Russian
military forces in occupied Donbas to
pull their tanks farther away from the
frontline.
Unfortunately, Russia has found
other ways to attack Ukrainian inter-
ests. In November of 2018, just a few
months ago, Russian naval vessels
opened fire and captured three Ukrain-
ian ships along with 24 sailors in inter-
national waters just south of the Kerch
Strait. Demonstrating his contempt for
the international rules-based order,
Vladimir Putin is using his naval su-
premacy in the region to slowly stran-
gle the Ukrainian economy, which re-
lies, in part, on steel and grain ship-
ping from ports in the Sea of Azov.
While our military aid has been suc-
cessful in assisting Ukrainian efforts
along the line of contact in Donbas, fu-
ture military aid must take into ac-
count Ukraine’s need for defensive
weapons and asymmetric capabilities
to counter Russian aggression both on
land and at sea. Only then can Ukraine
adequately defend its people and sov-
ereignty.
In addition to hostile military ac-
tion, Russian intelligence has been
working to undermine the upcoming
Ukrainian Presidential and parliamen-
tary elections. Much like the inter-
ference in our own elections in 2016,
Putin is seeking to sow discord, spread
confusion, and undermine the demo-
cratic system that has taken root in
Ukraine. This is indicative of Russia’s
global strategy, which seeks to drive a
wedge between the United States and
our allies, undermine democratic gov-
ernments, and return to an era of
power politics in which brute strength
rather than the rule of law governs
global interactions.
China has adopted a similar, albeit
more subtle and increasingly aggres-
sive, strategy in Asia, with an over-
arching goal of displacing American
global leadership. Thus, it is more im-
portant than ever for the United States
to work by, with, and through our al-
lies around the world to ensure a fu-
ture in which our values of freedom,
the rule of law, human rights, and free
markets prevail for generations to
come.
Today freedom’s frontier runs
through the line of contact in eastern
Ukraine. We must never turn our backs
on a people yearning for the same free-
doms we enjoy in the United States.
Doing so not only legitimizes the ac-
tions of thugs—yes, thugs—around the
world but will inevitably threaten our
own rights and freedoms tomorrow,

S1616 March 4, 2019
We are Americans, and we will al-
ways answer the call to preserve free-
dom while reaching out a hand to those
who are fighting to achieve it.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama is recognized.
TORNADOES IN ALABAMA
Mr. JONES. Mr. President, people
across the country and around the
world today have seen the images of
the terrible devastation left by torna-
does that touched down in Lee County,
AL.
Lee County is home to Auburn Uni-
versity, and so many of the wonderful
constituents there have suffered might-
ily over the last 24 hours. As of right
now, we know 23 people have lost their
lives—23—and as we speak, rescue
teams and first responders are still out
searching for others who may have
been hurt. We pray that we have seen
the last of the loss of life, but that is to
be determined.
Already, this is one of the deadliest
storms in our State’s history, and Lou-
ise and I want to offer our most sincere
condolences to all of those who have
been affected by this horrible event.
The youngest victim we know of was
only 6 years old. My heart goes out to
all the folks who have lost loved ones,
who suffered damage to their homes
and their businesses, and I ask that ev-
eryone pray for their comfort and heal-
ing.
I also thank the courageous first re-
sponders who put their lives on the line
time and again to help folks in need.
Our rescue crews are working around
the clock, and we are so grateful to
them for the work they do every day
but especially on days like today and
yesterday after tragedies like these
strike. These are our friends and neigh-
bors who step up in the wake of dis-
aster to help their community, some-
times—sometimes—while struggling
with the tragedy on a very personal
level themselves.
Unfortunately, this is an all-too-fa-
miliar sight in Alabama. We have seen
our fair share of natural disasters. On a
single day in 2011, an estimated 60 tor-
nadoes devastated so many towns and
cities, including Cullman, Hackleburg,
Pratt City, and Tuscaloosa, killing
over 200 people. All of these have a way
of being personal.
That day was especially personal for
my wife, Louise, who is from Cullman.
I was out of town that day attending a
judicial conference and called her as
she was watching on television how her
town was being destroyed, debris flying
everywhere, and she could barely
speak. She can still barely speak about
it today. As U.S. attorney, in April of
1998, I saw firsthand the devastating
damage to the Oak Grove and
Edgewater communities, where 32 peo-
ple lost their lives. That destruction in
Edgewater was especially personal to
me because that is where my grand-
parents lived for so many years and
where my parents lived when I was
first born. I can remember walking
that day across the slab that was left
of the little church my parents at-
tended when I was born, walking across
with President Clinton. It is unbeliev-
able to witness that kind of damage.
Jacksonville, AL, is still rebuilding
after a tornado severely damaged their
city last year, including the campus of
Jacksonville State University. Last
fall, Hurricane Michael ravaged our
farmlands in the Wiregrass in South
Alabama, destroying cotton crops that
were ready for harvest and 30-year-old
timber. Yesterday’s tornadoes touched
down at a time when North Alabama is
already dealing with historic flooding
in Cherokee County.
I mentioned, it just seems all too
often these have a personal note. As I
checked in with my staff last night, I
realized that two of my staffers who
are with me on the floor today, Garrett
and Michael, also are from that area.
They also are concerned. It is a hor-
rible situation to be this far away,
knowing what is going on in your
hometown and not knowing whether
your loved ones are in the path of that
destruction.
Alabama, however, is a resilient
place, and we have an incredibly capa-
ble disaster preparedness and response
agency, one that works around the
clock when needed, but given all we
have faced over the past year, we will
still need help. While there is much yet
to be done in the immediate aftermath
of this storm, we know a full recovery
will take a great deal of time and re-
sources.
So I am here tonight to ask my col-
leagues in the Senate to stand ready to
help Lee County rebuild and heal. Dis-
asters will strike all of our commu-
nities at some point or another, and
that makes it all the more important
that we work together when they do.
To the folks in Lee County, AL, who
have lost everything and who have lost
loved ones in this disaster, I am in this
with you for the long haul. I promise
you that. I know things will never be
the same for many folks, but I do
promise that I will do everything I can
to help.
I have already been working with
Senators PERDUE, ISAKSON, and others
to secure disaster funding for the 2018
storms that hit the Southeast last
year. We are hoping that we can get an
agreement on that bill very soon and
get it onto the President’s desk so
those farmers can be ready for the next
planting season that they are about to
go into.
In the days ahead, I am going to be
working closely with colleagues here in
the Senate to secure Federal disaster
funding that includes Lee County, AL,
because, despite the fact that we are in
the early stages, it is easy to see from
the photographs and the videos of the
devastation that they will need it.
We have been in touch with Governor
Ivey and other local officials about how
we in the Senate can best help. As the
dust settles, we will be down there to
try to make sure that our offices do
what is necessary to help those fine
people.
In the face of all of these terrible
tragedies, the thing that gives me hope
is the strength of my fellow Alabam-
ians. They are an amazing—amazing—
citizenry. From one end of the State to
the other, they are amazing people who
see tragedy, but they build on that
tragedy. Yet they never lose hope.
Even though an event like this can be
incredibly difficult, I have seen the re-
solve of the people of Alabama, and I
know that we will be able to rise and
rebuild.
Thank you.
TRIBUTE TO RICHARD C. SHELBY
Mr. President, I will conclude my re-
marks on that, but I would like to take
one other moment.
At this point, I want to take this op-
portunity to congratulate my friend
and my Senate colleague RICHARD
SHELBY.
Yesterday, Sunday, March 2, he be-
came the longest serving Alabama Sen-
ator in history, beating the record of
the late-Senator John Sparkman, who
was a Vice Presidential nominee.
Senator SHELBY’s legacy in Alabama
is unparalleled, beginning over in the
House of Representatives, when he was
first elected to this body in the elec-
tion of 1986, taking office in January of
1986. He is leaving a remarkable mark
on Alabama every day that he is in the
U.S. Senate.
There are so many things that the
people of Alabama are thankful for. I
can assure you, I am both thankful and
honored to be in the Senate with him
and to serve alongside him.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia is recognized.
Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to be recognized for
2 minutes.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
TORNADOES IN ALABAMA AND GEORGIA
Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am
from Georgia. Last night in Georgia,
Alabama, and throughout the South-
east, one of the worst tornadoes went
through that has ever gone through in
history.
Twenty-three Alabamians were killed
last night; a number of homes in Geor-
gia were wiped out and ruined. I don’t
think we had a death, but they had 23
in Alabama. The tragedies we are hav-
ing in the Southeast continue to rise.
In a few weeks, we are going to ask
the Senate to pass a disaster bill to re-
instate some of the agricultural money
for the last 2 years for our pecan crop,
our blueberry crop, and others.
On behalf of the people of Georgia, I
just want to say that we are having a
tough time. Our agricultural commu-
nity is in the most difficult time it
could possibly be. We are going to ask
the Senate to work with us to find ap-
propriations that would make sense to
bring back those pecan and blueberry
farmers in Georgia, Alabama, and

We also say a prayer of thanksgiving
for the great opportunity we have to
live in the Southeast but also recognize
that we are now ground zero for torna-
does and those types of death-defying
acts that are taking place. We want all
of the people in Georgia and Alabama
to know that our prayers go out to
them. We will do everything we can to
make them right.
Thank you.

REMEMBERING BERTA CACERES
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 3 years
ago yesterday, Berta Caceres, an indig-
enous rights activist in Honduras who
had been a vocal opponent of the con-
struction of a hydroelectric dam that
threatened the territory of the Lenka
people, was murdered in her home.
That cowardly crime, about which I
have spoken many times, was the cul-
mination of years of harassment and
threats against her life, and it was by
no means an isolated case. At the time,
it was only the latest of scores of as-
sassinations of social activists who
protested against the confiscation of
land, forced evictions, and infrastruc-
ture development involving corrupt
payoffs to circumvent environmental
and social safeguards, and against
abuses by Honduran security forces.
Nobody has been punished for any of
those other, similar, crimes.
I did not know Berta Caceres, but I
knew of her. I remember when she was
awarded the prestigious Goldman Envi-
ronmental Prize. I remember the dis-
gust and outrage I felt when I learned
that she had been murdered.
I remember thinking that whoever
would murder Berta Caceres, a char-
ismatic leader who was recognized not
only in her native country but around
the world, must have been confident
that they would never see the inside of
a jail cell, because in Honduras only a
small fraction of homicides, not to
mention other violent crimes, ever re-
sults in conviction. Impunity and the
corruption that enables it is a way of
life there.
It was no surprise that in the days
and weeks after Berta Caceres was
murdered, the Honduran police tried to
cover it up. It was only because of
international pressure, including by
the U.S. Embassy, that the fraudulent
‘‘investigation’’ did not end there, as so
often happens in Honduras when the
victim is not someone of notoriety.
Eventually, last November, after
what seemed like interminable foot
dragging, a trial resulted in the convic-
tion of seven of those involved. That
was a significant achievement, consid-
ering that absent international pres-
sure Berta Caceres’s case would have
faded from memory like all the others.
That trial also implicated top officials
of the hydroelectric company DESA,
one of whom is still awaiting trial 3
years later.
I was a prosecutor before I became a
Senator. I prosecuted many murder
cases. While premeditated murder is a
horrific crime, it is often relatively
easy to prove. In Berta Caceres’s case,
there was a lot of evidence. So to those
who ask why, 3 years later, we are still
waiting for justice, I think the answer
is obvious. There are powerful forces
within the Honduran Government who
are beyond the reach of the Honduran
justice system, and the attorney gen-
eral recognizes that.
So today, 3 years later, there are
some who conceived of, or knew of, the
plan to murder Berta Caceres who have
not been charged. The question, 3 years
later, is when will they be charged?
When will they be brought to justice?
Neither I nor the world have forgot-
ten Berta Caceres. Our desire to see
justice done in her case is as strong
today as it was 3 years ago not only be-
cause of the importance it has for her
family and her community, but for the
larger cause of justice in Honduras. Im-
punity is a powerful, evil force, but I
believe the whole truth about this
crime will eventually be known.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1618 March 4, 2019
Beyond Berta Caceres’s case, the cen-
tral question is whether the Honduran
Government is serious about fighting
the corruption that permeates not only
the justice system, but practically
every crevice of Honduran society and
Government.
A government that is serious about
fighting corruption would enact the
plea bargaining law that has lan-
guished for years, without which it is
extremely difficult to investigate and
prosecute crimes involving top public
officials or corporate executives.
A government that is serious about
fighting corruption would put an ab-
rupt end to legislation referred to as
the ‘‘impunity pact.’’ That legislation
would bar the attorney general from
bringing charges against someone for
stealing public funds until the Supreme
Auditing Tribunal, whose members are
all loyal to the President, has inves-
tigated and ruled on the alleged theft.
It is a transparent attempt to ensure
that cases of public corruption are
never prosecuted.
A government that is serious about
fighting corruption would support
strengthening the Mission to Support
the Fight against Corruption and Im-
punity, not seek to ‘‘renegotiate’’ its
mandate to eliminate or substantially
weaken its investigative authority.
The Honduran Government, which
professes to be a partner of the United
States in fighting corruption, is not
doing any of these things. The inescap-
able truth is that it is not serious
about fighting corruption, which is ap-
parent to anyone who is not easily
fooled.
Until that changes and until all
those involved in the murder of Berta
Caceres are brought to justice and
until Hondurans who speak out against
corruption and impunity are no longer
vilified and attacked, the amount of
assistance we provide to the Honduran
Government will be far less than it
would otherwise be.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO COLONEL IAN BRYAN
∑ Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President,
today I honor Col. Ian Bryan of the
Tennessee Air National Guard for his
outstanding service to our country and
congratulate him on his retirement
from the U.S. Air Force. Colonel Bryan
has worked closely with me, the Appro-
priations Committee, and across Cap-
itol Hill to inform and advise Congress
so that we may ensure a strong and
ready National Guard. He has also
helped the Pentagon work more pro-
ductively with Congress, promoting a
strong national defense.
Colonel Bryan has distinguished him-
self through his professional character
and dedication to serving this Nation
in the military for over 25 years. He
has done so selflessly. He has quietly,
but tenaciously advocated for the Chief
of the National Guard Bureau’s prior-
ities to make the National Guard a
ready, capable force for operations
both in the homeland and overseas.
As the Chief of the programs division
in the National Guard Bureau Office of
Legislative Liaison from April 2017 to
February 2019, Colonel Bryan per-
formed his duties deftly. His strategic-
level thinking and foresight contrib-
uted to the completion of numerous
high-level engagements between the
National Guard and Congress. He was
vital in the establishment of the first
ever National Guard liaison office in
the Senate, greatly increasing the com-
munication between the National
Guard and Congress.
Colonel Bryan is a 1990 graduate of
the U.S. Air Force Academy, with mas-
ters from The Ohio State University,
and a law degree from the University of
Virginia. He has served as a KC–135
Pilot, professor at the School of Ad-
vanced Air and Space Studies, air team
leader in the National Guard Bureau,
Office of Legislative Liaison, and as a
division chief at the Air National
Guard Readiness Center.
After serving in his latest role for the
past 2 years, Colonel Bryan will retire
at the end of the month. Ian, his sup-
portive wife Emily, and their two chil-
dren have sacrificed much as a family
in service to our Nation. I join my col-
leagues today in congratulating Colo-
nel Bryan on his well-earned retire-
ment and in expressing our gratitude
for his selfless service.∑

TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN JON ‘‘JR’’
RODGERS
∑ Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President,
today I honor one of my constituents,
CAPT Jon ‘‘JR’’ Rodgers of the U.S.
Navy, who is retiring in June after
three decades of dedicated service to
our great Nation. JR has spent the last
2 years of his career serving the U.S.
Congress as the Navy’s Deputy Chief of
Legislative Affairs. In this role, JR
maintained oversight of the Navy team
that provides Members and committees
of Congress with information con-
cerning the programs of the Depart-
ment of the Navy.
JR’s Tennessee roots run deep. The
son of an air traffic control chief, he
began life in Humbolt, TN, married his
beautiful wife Sherry Masters from
Celina, TN, and plans to return to our
great State once his naval service has
ended.
This patriot’s naval career began by
enlisting as a nuclear trained elec-
tronics technician until receiving an
NROTC scholarship to Cornell Univer-
sity. He graduated with a bachelor’s of
science degree in agriculture engineer-
ing technologies and received his com-
mission as a surface warfare officer in
1990. JR continued his education by at-
tending the National Defense Univer-
sity, graduating with honors from the
Industrial College of the Armed Forces
with a masters of science degree in na-
tional resource strategy. He also at-
tended the Naval War College in New-
port, RI, with a masters of arts in na-
tional security strategy.
His sea duty assignments include
tours on the USS England, CG 22, and
the USS Bonhomme Richard, LHD 6, as
a plank owner, where he received the
Surface Navy Association’s Arleigh
Burke award for Operational Excel-
lence. He also served as executive offi-
cer aboard the USS Cleveland, LPD 7,
during Operations Iraqi Freedom and
Enduring Freedom as part of Amphib-
ious Task Force West.
More recently, JR commanded the
mighty USS Makin Island, LHD 8, the
first Navy ship with hybrid electric
propulsion, where he completed a suc-
cessful deployment to 5th and 7th
Fleet. He also commanded USS Ponce,
AFSB 15, as the Navy’s first dedicated
afloat forward staging base perma-
nently deployed to Fifth Fleet.
JR’s overseas experience is just as
impressive. He served as the U.S. Euro-
pean Command J3 chief of staff and
branch head for the crisis action group
during Operations Odyssey Dawn and
Unified Protector. He commanded Mar-
itime Expeditionary Security Squad-
ron Six, where he led over 600 Active
and Reserve sailors on worldwide secu-
rity missions that included the USNS
Comfort Theater Security Cooperation
missions throughout South America.
He served as commander Task Unit
Northern Arabian Gulf on the Iraq Al
Basrah, ABOT, and Khor al-Amaya,
KAAOT, oil terminals point defense
mission, Panama and Suez Canal Em-
barked Security Team transits, and
Operation Vigilant Mariner in Rota,
Spain.
I want to thank JR for his almost 30
years of loyal service to this Nation.
He has made a lasting and significant
contribution to the U.S. Navy and our
Nation. I wish him, his wife, and their
daughter all the best as they begin this
new chapter in their live.∑

REMEMBERING WILLIAM ‘‘BILL’’
MURRAY
∑ Mr. COONS. Mr. President, today, it
is with a heavy heart that I wish to
recognize the life and legacy of William
‘‘Bill’’ Murray, a tremendous advocate

State of Delaware. This week, advo-
cates from across the country will
travel to Washington, DC, to meet with

disease research.

the kidney disease community in 2014,
many patients, family members, and
caregivers throughout the country will

ment officials to increase awareness of

ney disease.

Bill worked tirelessly to increase
awareness about kidney disease in
Delaware, spending time volunteering
at local events, helping with commu-
nity health screenings, and organizing
support for World Kidney Day. True to
character, even in his death, he helped
those in need by being a deceased donor
for patients waiting for organ trans-
plants. As my family, staff, and I ex-
tend our deepest sympathies to all
those who had the privilege of knowing
Bill, I take comfort in knowing that
his impact, passion, and determination
will continue to bring hope to the kid-
ney disease community for years to

RECOGNIZING HOG TECHNOLOGIES
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, as chair-
man of the Committee on Small Busi-
ness and Entrepreneurship, each week I
recognize a small business that exem-
plifies the value of hard work and the
storied American entrepreneurial spir-
it. It is my privilege to honor a Florida
small business that exemplifies what it
means to overcome adversity and to
succeed as both a company and as a
community leader. Today, I recognize
Hog Technologies, of Stuart, FL, as the
Senate Small Business of the Week.
Previously known as Waterblasting
Technologies until a rebranding effort
last year, Hog Technologies has grown
significantly since its founding in 1988.
Founder and chief executive officer,
James P. Crocker, bought a single pres-
sure washer from a friend and began
knocking on doors to find work. Since
then, Hog Technologies has been a one-
of-a-kind entrepreneurial success story
that has revolutionized an entire in-
dustry.
After discovering the niche industry
of paint removal, James took a leap of
faith and bought a 10,000-psi water-
blasting machine. Soon, Hog Tech-
nologies was being awarded major con-
tracts for their services. After years of
success in this field, Hog Technologies
expanded to create fully functioning
models of a makeshift water-blasting
vehicle. In 1997, the Original Stripe Hog
was developed, effectively changing the
landscape of the hydroblasting indus-
try.
Today, Hog Technologies holds more
than 20 patents, has products operating
in 56 countries worldwide, and is a
world leader in marking removal and
pavement maintenance. Through
strong investments in research and de-
velopment, Hog has a diverse line of
products, ranging from rubber and
paint removal, to pavement marking
equipment and machines, to industrial
vacuums and hydro-excavators. In 2012,
the team at Hog Technologies cal-
culated that, over a period of 13 years,
they have placed more units worldwide
than their five largest competitors
combined. With international success,
they continue to expand by looking to
hire 130 new employees over the next 3
years. Hog Technologies is an incred-
ible American industrial success story.
Having remained local, Hog Tech-
nologies constructs their machines in
the United States and continues to
support Florida’s economy.
In addition to supporting the local
Stuart community, Hog Technologies
has financed a large portion of the con-
struction of a home for underprivileged
children in India. In 2017, James was
awarded the Stuart/Martin County
Chamber of Commerce Business Person
of the Year. Mr. Crocker has also re-
cently followed his creative passion
and began authoring children’s books
that aim to teach children leadership
skills. Hog Technologies and their em-
ployees are very involved in their com-
munity and pride themselves on chari-
table endeavors. Annually, they par-
ticipate in the Toys for Tots holiday
gift drive and in local parades where
they drive their machines through the
streets of Stuart.
Hog Technologies is an outstanding
example of a Florida manufacturing
success story. In true American fash-
ion, James and the team at Hog saw a
problem and created a solution. They
have seen incredible success, while re-
maining committed to supporting Stu-
art and its surrounding communities. I
would like to congratulate Mr. James
Crocker and the entire team at Hog
Technologies on being named the Sen-
ate Small Business of the Week. I wish
them good luck and look forward to
watching their continued growth and
success.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and
were referred or ordered to lie on the
table as indicated:
POM–7. A concurrent resolution adopted
by the General Assembly of the State of Ohio
condemning the Boycott, Divestment, and
Sanctions movement and the increasing
incidences of anti-Semitism; to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations.
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 10
Whereas, The citizens of the State of Ohio
have a history of standing against bigotry,
oppression, discrimination, and injustice;
and
Whereas, Ohio and Israel have a long his-
tory of friendship and are great allies in sup-
port of each other’s interests; and
Whereas, The State of Israel, the only de-
mocracy in the Middle East, is the greatest
friend and ally of the United States in the
Middle East; and
Whereas, Ohio is committed to increasing
the ties and interactions in business, govern-
ment, the arts, culture, and education be-
tween the State of Ohio and the State of
Israel, further strengthening the historic
ties between our State and that country; and
Whereas, Ties between Ohio’s and Israel’s
academic, research, business, and nonprofit
communities are both robust and long-
standing; and
Whereas, The elected representatives of
Ohio recognize the importance of expressing
their unabridged support for the Jewish peo-
ple and the State of Israel’s right to exist
and thrive, and their unabridged support for
Israel’s right of self-defense; and
Whereas, There are increasing incidents of
anti-Semitism around the world, including
across the United States and in Ohio, includ-
ing desecration of Jewish religious sites; and
Whereas, The international Boycott, Di-
vestment, and Sanctions movement is one of
the main vehicles for legitimizing anti-Semi-
tism on campus and advocating the elimi-
nation of the Jewish State; and
Whereas, Anti-Israel activities and activi-
ties promoting the Boycott, Divestment, and
Sanctions movement against Israel are wide-
spread in the State of Ohio, including on sev-
eral university campuses and in other Ohio
communities, and contribute to anti-Semitic
and anti-Zionistic propaganda and threats to
both American and Israeli Jewish students,
and result in deliberate interference with the
learning environment of all students; and
Whereas, The dramatic increase in Boy-
cott, Divestment, and Sanctions campaign
activities on college campuses around the
country has resulted in increased animosity
and intimidation against Jewish students,
negatively impacting student programming
of vital importance to all American students
related to the State of Israel and politics in
the Middle East; and
Whereas, Leaders of the Boycott, Divest-
ment, and Sanctions movement say their
goal is to eliminate Israel as the home of the
Jewish people, and signs and messaging at
anti-Israel rallies have adopted the Boycott,
Divestment, and Sanctions movement’s
theme slogan, ‘‘Palestine forever, Israel
Never Ever’’ meaning that the State of Israel
would cease to exist, falsely denying the
Jewish people’s and Israel’s historical con-
nection to its ancient home in the Land of
Israel, including the present day State of
Israel, and Jerusalem, Judea, and Samaria,
which were the heartland of the ancient na-
tions of Israel and Judah; and
Whereas, Ohio’s elected representatives
who defend the inalienable right to free
speech understand that the goals and activi-
ties of Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions
campaigns in Ohio are harmful to the State’s
relationships with Ohio’s Jewish citizens,
with Ohio’s non-Jewish citizens who support
the State of Israel and the Jewish people,
and with the Jewish homeland, Israel, and
have a deleterious impact on the educational
environment; and
Whereas, The Boycott, Divestment, and
Sanctions campaign’s call for academic boy-
cotts has been condemned by many of our
nation’s largest academic associations, over
two hundred fifty university presidents, and
many other leading scholars as a violation of
the bedrock principle of academic freedom;
and
Whereas, The members of the General As-
sembly condemn all groups, including white
nationalist, neo-Nazi, and national socialist
groups, that promote hatred, religious perse-
cution, or violence towards others: Now
therefore be it
Resolved, That the members of the General
Assembly condemn the international Boy-
cott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement
and its activities in Ohio for legitimizing
anti-Semitism and for seeking to undermine
the Jewish people’s right to self-determina-
tion, which they are fulfilling in the State of
Israel; and be it further
Resolved, That the members of the General
Assembly condemn activities that con-
tribute directly or indirectly to the denial,
violation, or delegitimization of any people’s
academic freedom, including, but not limited
to, promotion of academic boycotts by the
Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions move-
ment against Israel; and be it further
Resolved, That the members of the General
Assembly consider the international Boy-
cott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement
and its agenda inherently antithetical and
deeply damaging to the causes of peace, jus-
tice, equality, democracy, and human rights
for all peoples in the Middle East and in the
United States; and be it further
Resolved, That we, the members of the
132nd General Assembly of the State of Ohio,
reaffirm our support for the State of Israel,
recognize that the Jewish people are indige-
nous to the land of Israel, condemn all at-
tacks on the people of Israel, support Israel’s
right to engage in lawful acts of self-defense,
and oppose all attempts to deny the legit-
imacy of Israel as a sovereign state; and be
it further
Resolved, That we, the members of the
132nd General Assembly of the State of Ohio,
reaffirm our position that the trustees, ad-
ministrators, and educators at all levels in
our universities in Ohio, must take an active
stand against all anti-Semitic actions and
intimidation taken against Jewish students
on their campuses, whereby all students may
feel safe, and be safe, from harm due to these
pernicious activities; and be it further
Resolved, That the members of the General
Assembly encourage and support the exercise
of free speech and civil debate, particularly
on college campuses, and further encourage
university and college administrations to
curb any impediments to free speech and any
abridgment of free speech on campus by any
individuals or groups, and urge them to take
disciplinary action against all students, fac-
ulty, and administrators who engage in ac-
tions that abridge free speech on campus in
violation of the First Amendment to the
Constitution of the United States; and be it
further
Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of
Representatives transmit duly authenticated
copies of this resolution to the President of
the United States, the Speaker and Clerk of
the United States House of Representatives,
the President and Secretary of the United
States Senate, the Chancellor of Higher Edu-
cation and each of the nine members of the
Ohio Board of Regents, the provosts and
chairpersons of the boards of trustees of all
Ohio public and private colleges and univer-
sities, and the Israeli Embassy in Wash-
ington, D.C., for transmission to the proper
authorities in the State of Israel.
POM–8. A resolution adopted by the House
of Representatives of the State of Michigan
urging the United States Congress to grant
additional authority to the Federal Commu-
nications Commission allowing for the Com-
mission to stop unwanted robocalls and ‘‘call
spoofing’’; to the Committee on Commerce,
Science, and Transportation.
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 386
Whereas, Receipt of unwanted telephone
calls is the most frequent complaint received
by the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) from consumers nationwide. Unwanted
calls include automated telemarketing or so-
licitation calls that deliver a recorded mes-
sage (also known as robocalls); and
Whereas, Recently, these robocalls have
been combined with a process called ‘‘spoof-
ing’’ in which the call appears to originate
from a local, often legitimate, number to
trick consumers into answering the call. As
technology continues to evolve, the number
of robocalls and spoofing continues to grow;
and
Whereas, Under the federal Truth in Caller
ID Act, individuals are prohibited from
transmitting misleading or inaccurate caller
ID information with the intent to defraud,
cause harm, or wrongly obtain anything of
value. Although the FCC has initiated new
policy initiatives to combat illegal robocalls
and ID spoofing, more needs to be done; and
Whereas, Congress should pass legislation
to provide the FCC with the tools and re-
sources it needs to combat illegal and disrup-
tive robocalls; and
Whereas, The FCC encourages consumers
to file a complaint when an illegal call is re-
ceived. Although the FCC uses social media
and the internet to reach consumers, the
FCC should use all means available to pro-
vide consumers with information needed to
file a complaint; Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the House of Representatives,
That we urge the Congress of the United
States to grant additional authority to the
Federal Communications Commission allow-
ing it to stop unwanted robocalls and ‘‘call
spoofing’’; and be it further
Resolved, That we urge the Federal Com-
munications Commission to educate the pub-
lic on how to report illegal telephone calls;
and be it further
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be
transmitted to the President of the United
States Senate, the Speaker of the United
States House of Representatives, the mem-
bers of the Michigan congressional delega-
tion, and the chairman and commissioners of
the Federal Communications Commission.

S. RES. 92
Whereas dangerous asbestos fibers are in-

Whereas the inhalation of airborne asbes-

Whereas asbestos fibers can cause cancer
(such as mesothelioma), asbestosis, and
other health problems;

Whereas the projected life expectancy for
an individual diagnosed with mesothelioma
is between 6 and 24 months;
Whereas little is known about late-stage
treatment of asbestos-related diseases, and
there is no cure for those diseases;
Whereas early detection of asbestos-re-
lated diseases might give some patients in-
creased treatment options and might im-
prove the prognoses of those patients;
Whereas, although the consumption of as-
bestos within the United States has been
substantially reduced, the United States
continues to consume tons of the fibrous
mineral each year for use in certain products
throughout the United States;
Whereas thousands of people in the United
States have died from asbestos-related dis-
eases and thousands more die every year
from those diseases;
Whereas, although individuals continue to
be exposed to asbestos, safety measures re-
lating to, and prevention of, asbestos expo-
sure have significantly reduced the incidence
of asbestos-related diseases and can further
reduce the incidence of those diseases;
Whereas thousands of workers in the
United States face significant asbestos expo-
sure, which has been a cause of occupational
cancer;
Whereas a significant percentage of all vic-
tims of asbestos-related diseases were ex-
posed to asbestos on naval ships and in ship-
yards;
Whereas asbestos was used in the construc-
tion of a significant number of office build-
ings and public facilities built before 1975;
Whereas people in the small community of
Libby, Montana, suffer from asbestos-related
diseases, including mesothelioma, at a sig-
nificantly higher rate than people in the
United States as a whole; and
Whereas the designation of a ‘‘National As-
bestos Awareness Week’’ will raise public
awareness about the prevalence of asbestos-
related diseases and the dangers of asbestos
exposure: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) designates the first week of April 2019
as ‘‘National Asbestos Awareness Week’’;
(2) urges the Surgeon General of the United
States to warn and educate people about the
public health issue of asbestos exposure,
which may be hazardous to their health; and
(3) respectfully requests that the Secretary
of the Senate transmit a copy of this resolu-
tion to the Office of the Surgeon General.

COMMEMORATING THE CENTEN-
NIAL ANNIVERSARY OF KOREA’S
MARCH FIRST MOVEMENT DAY
HON. GRACE MENG
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, March 4, 2019
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
celebrate the centennial anniversary of Ko-
rea’s March First Movement Day. On March 1,
1919, the Korean Declaration of Independ-
ence, inspired by President Woodrow Wilson’s
Fourteen Points and the first of a people to
self-determination was read aloud in Seoul for
the first time.
Korea’s hard-fought independence would
not have been possible without brave and
committed activists like 16-year-old Yu Gwan-
sun, who gave her life in the name of inde-
pendence and died from the injuries she sus-
tained while she was imprisoned. Yu became
the face of the Korean independence move-
ment, giving speeches at rallies that drew
thousands of participants.
Korea’s March First Movement inspired
other non-violence and independence move-
ments around the world, including the impor-
tant work of Mahatma Gandhi.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to have intro-
duced a resolution last week that celebrates
this history with my new colleague—Congress-
man ANDY KIM of New Jersey. This resolution
recognizes the impact of all youth human
rights activists; the indelible contributions of
Korean Americans to the vibrancy of United
States society, politics, culture, and the econ-
omy; and reaffirms the U.S.-ROK alliance as
the lynchpin of U.S. engagement in Northeast
Asia.
Thank you for joining me in honoring this
important and historic day.

NATHANIEL FLETCHER
HON. ED PERLMUTTER
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, March 4, 2019
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud Nathaniel
Fletcher for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge
Service Ambassadors for Youth award.
Nathaniel Fletcher is a student at Pomona
High School and received this award because
his determination and hard work have allowed
him to overcome adversities.
The dedication demonstrated by Nathaniel
Fletcher is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and
perseverance. It is essential students at all
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will
guide them for the rest of their lives.
I extend my deepest congratulations to Na-
thaniel Fletcher for winning the Arvada Wheat
Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award.
I have no doubt he will exhibit the same dedi-
cation and character in all of his future accom-
plishments.

PERSONAL EXPLANATIO
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, March 4, 2019
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, be-
cause of unavoidable conflict, I unfortunately
missed votes on February 27. Had I been in
attendance, I would have made the following
votes:
On roll call No. 100, I would have voted
aye.
On roll call No. 101, I would have voted
aye.
On roll call No. 102, I would have voted
nay.
On roll call No. 103, I would have voted
aye.
The Enhanced Background Checks Act of
2019, H.R. 1112, addresses a loophole in fed-
eral gun background check laws. Currently, a
gun buyer only needs to wait 3 business days
to acquire a gun without a background check.
This bill fixes a lapse in oversight, by allowing
the FBI 20 business days to conduct their
check.
f
MARK TAKAI ATOMIC VETERANS
HEALTHCARE PARITY ACT
HON. GRACE MENG
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, March 4, 2019
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the 4,000 veterans who participated
in the nuclear cleanup of Enewetak Atoll, the
site of 43 nuclear tests in the Marshall Islands.
The servicemembers who participated in its
nuclear cleanup between 1977 and 1980 suf-
fer from high rates of cancers due to their ex-
posure to radiation and nuclear waste.
That is why, on February 26th, I introduced
the ‘‘Mark Takai Atomic Veterans Healthcare
Parity Act’’. This bill would permit veterans
who participated in the nuclear cleanup of
Enewetak Atoll to be treated as ‘‘radiation-ex-
posed veterans.’’ This change in law will allow
servicemembers who performed the largest
nuclear cleanup ever undertaken to receive
the medical care they now need for service-
connected cancers and diseases. Current law
only covers servicemembers who participated
in active nuclear tests, not those who partici-
pated in the cleanup.
These veterans served our nation with
honor and distinction, but are currently unable
to receive the same treatments and service-re-
lated disability presumptions that other ‘‘radi-
ation-exposed veterans’’ receive.
Madam Speaker, of the 4,000 veterans who
risked their lives on the radiological cleanup of
Enewetak Atoll, only about ten percent are
alive today. These survivors, who are now in
their late 50s and 60s, have cancer and are
fighting for their lives.
This legislation is named after the late Rep.
Mark Takai—a veteran of the U.S. Army and
Hawaii Army National Guard who passed
away in 2016—and who originally introduced
the bill in the 114th Congress.
Madam Speaker, my hope is that Congress
will finally right this wrong, and help the men
and women who sacrificed their youth and
health in service of this great nation.

HON. JOHN SHIMKUS

Monday, March 4, 2019
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize Mr. Allan G. Kimball, who is retiring
after serving for 21 years as the Theatre Di-
rector of Southeastern Illinois College.
Mr. Kimball has been directing shows since
1977, working with several high school thea-
tres and at Southeastern Illinois College. He
has passionately worked hard to assist many
students, encouraging them and nurturing their
talents. His efforts have resulted with Mr.
Kimball receiving two prestigious Illinois the-
atre awards during his career.
The community at Southeastern Illinois Col-
lege has been greatly impacted by his service.
His hard work and dedication prompted the
college to name their theater stage after Mr.
Kimball. The theatre will now be a symbol of
his significant role at the college and a re-
minder of his passion and dedication.

RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT
OF DONALD FLAKE FARMER
HON. TRENT KELLY
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, March 4, 2019
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize the retirement of
Chief Donald Flake Farmer. Chief Farmer, a
native of Coffeeville, Mississippi, is retiring
after a long and distinguished career.
Chief Farmer is a founder of the Snow Lake
Volunteer Fire Department. Through his efforts
the town has seen a steady improvement in
insurance ratings and has been a trend setter
in fire protection in the region. Chief Farmer
also serves as President of Snow Lake Fire
District and heads the Benton County Fire
Chiefs Association.
Chief Farmer has given the last 50 years to
the advancement of Snow Lake Shores and
Benton County Mississippi. He has been a
leader for the July 4th celebration and Santa
Claus at the Fire House. He was also the Po-
lice Chief for the Town of Snow Lake.
Chief Farmer has given and done whatever
was needed to help the people of Snow Lake
and Benton County for many years. I wish him

served retirement.

CONGRATULATING STEVEN
ROEGGE ON BEING NAMED EAST
PEORIA’S NEW POLICE CHIEF
HON. CHERI BUSTOS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, March 4, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Mr. Steven Roegge on being
named East Peoria’s next police chief. His 31
years of service at the Peoria Police Depart-
ment have not gone unnoticed.
Mr. Roegge began his career in law en-
forcement after receiving a criminal justice de-
gree from Illinois State University and earning
a certificate in supervision of police personnel
from Northwestern University. He then went
on and served as a lieutenant with the Peoria
Police Department for the past 11 years,
where he worked as a vice and narcotics in-
vestigator. Additionally, he worked closely with
the K9 Unit by serving as a K9 sergeant and
training other officers and their K9s, while also
developing active shooter trainings for the de-
partment. Mr. Roegge has also represented
the Peoria Police Department with the Illinois
Law Enforcement Alarms System to further his
leadership within the department. I would like
to express my gratitude for the work he has
done to protect our community and I look for-
ward to seeing what he will accomplish in his
new role.
As the wife of a sheriff, I know how impor-
tant it is to share our gratitude for those who
put their lives on the line for our communities.
Dedicated leaders like Mr. Steven Roegge
make me especially proud to serve Illinois’
17th Congressional District. Madam Speaker, I
would like to again formally congratulate Mr.
Steven Roegge on his well-earned promotion
to East Peoria Police Chief, and thank him for
all of his service to the community.

RECOGNIZING POLICE SERVICE
REPRESENTATIVE III ULRIC J.
PATTILLO, JR. OF LOS ANGELES
HON. NORMA J. TORRES
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, March 4, 2019
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Police Service Rep-
resentative III Ulric J. Pattillo, Jr. of Los Ange-
les. After 40 years of dedicated public service
to the people and communities of the City of
Los Angeles, Ulric is finally retiring and will be
sorely missed.
Ulric’s incredible career with the Los Ange-
les Police Department began on February 2,
1979 as a Station Officer. He was com-
mended for conducting himself in a profes-
sional manner and doing an outstanding job.
He served in this capacity until he transferred
to Communications Division as a Police Serv-
ice Representative on December 1, 1981.
Ulric received many commendations during
his career, including but not limited to: his
service during the Valley Bureau cutover to
ECCCS and the 1992 Civil Unrest; recognition
for National Dispatchers week; and out-
standing support of field officers during emer-
gency situations.
He was deeply involved in his community
outside of the department by volunteering as
a poll worker, serving as an AFSCME Union
Shop Steward, being a member of the PSR
Task Force, and being selected as
Councilperson for the Employee Council and
End of Watch Cadre.
His friendly character and positive approach
left an indelible mark at Communications Divi-
sion. His dedication to the profession, the
community, the Department and the City of
Los Angeles is highly commendable, and has
earned him the esteem of the men and
women of the Los Angeles Police Department,
Communications Division.
For his remarkable accomplishments, it is
my honor to recognize Police Service Rep-
resentative III Ulric J. Pattillo, Jr. on the House
floor today. His decades of commitment and
contributions to the City of Los Angeles are
worthy of commending and admiration.

31ST ANNIVERSARY OF THE ETH-
NIC ATTACKS AGAINST ARME-
NIANS IN SUMGAIT, AZERBAIJAN
HON. TJ COX
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, March 4, 2019
Mr. COX of California. Madam Speaker,
February 27th marks the 31st anniversary of
the ethnic attacks against Armenians in
Sumgait, Azerbaijan. During these horrific po-
groms, hundreds of Armenians were wounded
or murdered, women and children were raped
and even burned alive. Despite Sumgait’s
close proximity to Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku,
police and law enforcement stood by and al-
lowed the persecution to continue on for three
days.
The violence was just the start of continued
attacks against Armenians in Azerbaijan, re-
sulting in a war with Nagorno-Karabakh where
thousands of more were killed. To this day,
the conflict in Azerbaijan remains and a mili-
tary blockade of the Nagorno-Karabakh Re-
public continues. Devastatingly, these po-
groms have led to a huge refugee crisis, ulti-
mately displacing thousands and eliminating
the once-significant Armenian population in
Azerbaijan.
The government of Azerbaijan has never
been held accountable for these atrocities.
Now more than ever these acts of murder
must be condemned. As we mourn the loss of
the innocent lives, we must be mindful of the
ongoing conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, the re-
curring incidents of hate rhetoric led by Azeri

must commit to fruitful negotiations to bring
lasting peace in Nagorno-Karabakh.
Madam Speaker, I call upon my colleagues
to join me in condemning this violence and in-
justice. We must learn from this atrocity and
continue to advocate for the protection of
human rights for the Armenian people, and for
all. I’m committed to working with my col-
leagues on the Armenian Caucus to always
remember the victims of the pogroms in
Sumgait and to ensure this history never re-

HONORING RAMOLA AND THE
LATE RAMESH ‘‘BOB’’ MOTWANI
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, March 4, 2019
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to rise today to honor Ramola and her
late husband Bob Motwani for their integral
contributions to the City of Fort Lauderdale
and to congratulate them on being recognized
as ‘‘Honored Founders’’ of Fort Lauderdale.
After hearing that the city was flourishing
due to large numbers of spring breakers,
Ramola and Bob moved to Fort Lauderdale
and purchased the Merrimac Hotel in 1986.
However, the city’s crackdown on spring break
that same year led to a sharp decline in busi-
ness, making it difficult to support their family.
In the face of this adversity, Bob set out to
find new guests from around the world and
began working with local beach committees.
These committees sought infrastructure and
other improvements that would attract more
visitors to the beach. This hard work and de-
termination paid off, attracting more visitors,
businesses, and developers to the area. Their
success allowed them to purchase additional
properties for redevelopment and make an
even bigger impact on the city.
Following Bob’s untimely passing at the age
of 47, Ramola took the reins managing their
properties and raising their two sons. Ramola
has continued the family’s active civic engage-
ment in beach development and redevelop-
ment issues, including securing sponsors for
projects the city couldn’t afford on its own.
Madam Speaker, we have only just
scratched the surface of the myriad contribu-
tions the Motwanis have made to revitalize
Fort Lauderdale and turn it into the thriving
city we have today. Congratulations to the
Motwanis on this well-deserved recognition.

RECOGNIZING THE SCHLARMAN
HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS’ BASKET-
BALL TEAM
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, March 4, 2019
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to
congratulate the Danville Schlarman High
School girls’ basketball team on winning the
2019 Illinois Class 1A championship.
Schlarman defeated Lanark Eastland 62–36 in
the final. The win capped a 31–2 season and
the Hilltoppers’ second consecutive state title.
The tremendous amount of hard work and
dedication the team put forth during the sea-
son was apparent in its dominant victories dur-
ing the state playoffs. A 17-point win in the
semifinals was the team’s smallest margin of
victory in postseason play. During the past two
seasons, the Hilltoppers have posted a com-
bined 62–3 record.
Head Coach Keith Peoples molded a team
with both a high-powered offense and a stingy
defense. The Hilltoppers scored 80 or more
points seven times and yielded 20 or fewer on
seven occasions. The 2018–19 team was led
by four standout seniors—Destiny Dye, Janiah
Newell, Anaya Peoples, and Sydney Gouard—
along with junior Capria Brown.
It gives me great pleasure to extend my sin-
cere congratulations to the entire team, which
also included CeCe Damilano, Tannah
Ceader, Taylor Fowler, Suzette Semersheim,
Lauren Barnette, McKaylee Allen, and Emma
Bogen. Coach Peoples was assisted by Jerry
O’Neill, David Gouard, and Ollie Harrison, and
team managers were Ana Fitzgerald, Eliza-
beth Stimac, and Molly Deboard.
Madam Speaker, the players, coaches, and
entire school community should be very proud
of their accomplishments. I wish the grad-
uating seniors all the best in their future en-
deavors and good luck to those who will return
for a chance to make it three in a row next
season.

CONGRATULATING LOGAN
BRINSON FOR OPENING TWO LO-
CATIONS OF ‘‘LOGAN’S LITTLE
LIBRARY’’ IN ALPHA, ILLINOIS
HON. CHERI BUSTOS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, March 4, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Logan Brinson, whose love for
reading and sharing books with others has led
to him opening two locations of ‘‘Logan’s Little
Library’’ in Alpha, Illinois.
Logan, a five-year old from Alpha, Illinois,
noticed that his town did not have a library
when he moved there in 2017. As a result,
Logan decided to start one himself by building
one right in his own front yard—that way, he
could share his love of books and reading with
others in the community. ‘‘Logan’s Little Li-
brary’’ now stands out front of his house and
serves as a space where members of the
community may pick a book up that they are
interested in reading and also drop books off
that they would like to share with others.
Logan has also included books that he has
finished reading as well as some others from
his collection. The success of ‘‘Logan’s Little
Library’’ has even led to the opening of a sec-
ond location, which will be ready in May 2019.
The second location came about after Logan
made his case to the village that some chil-
dren are unable to cross the busy Highway
150 and therefore cannot reach the Library.
Logan’s idea has even drawn the attention of
those in other countries, and he has since re-
ceived book donations from London and Aus-
tralia.
It is because of dedicated leaders such as
Logan Brinson that I am especially proud to
serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional District.
Madam Speaker, I would like to again formally
congratulate Logan Brinson on sharing his
love for books and inspiring the Alpha commu-
nity.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks

legislation demonstrates what can be accom-
plished when we collaborate and negotiate. As
a member of the House Committee on Natural
Resources, it is my responsibility to help pro-
tect and manage our natural resources.
In my home state of California, national
parks hold a special place in our hearts. This
bill expands several national parks in Cali-
fornia, notably Death Valley, Joshua Tree, and
Mojave National Park. In addition, it expands
wilderness designation, recreation and con-
servation areas, national monument designa-
tions, national trail system, and our national
wild and scenic river system.
While I applaud extensions of our public
lands for all Americans to enjoy, Congress
must do its job to ensure appropriate infra-
structure maintenance. California’s 16th Dis-
trict is the gateway to the crown jewel of the
Sierra Nevada, Yosemite National Park. Yo-
semite alone has more than $555 million dol-
lars in deferred maintenance. Last Congress,
I cosponsored the National Park Legacy Act
because I believe Congress can and should
do more to ensure the legacy of our National
Parks.
A critical part of this bill permanently author-
izes the Land and Water Conservation Fund,
a key program that helped protect nearly 2.5
million acres and provided $4 billion in state
grants for conservation and recreation
projects. As I have consistently advocated for
over the years, it is imperative we turn our at-
tention to fixing our broken water infrastruc-
ture. I applaud my colleagues in the Senate
and the House for including legislation ad-
dressing the Contra Costa Canal Transfer.
This project is a common-sense solution that
allows the water district to complete necessary
safety improvements to the canal while reduc-
ing government regulation. For California’s
16th District, similar action is needed towards
fixing the Friant-Kern Canal, the largest part of
the Central Valley Project on the eastside of
the Central Valley.
Through smart policy and prudent leader-
ship, I am confident that we can work together
and ensure generations of future Americans
can access, manage, and protect their natural
resources.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me
in supporting the passage S. 47, the Natural
Resources Management Act and I urge them
to vote YES.

IN RECOGNITION OF JUDGE ALICE
A. LYTLE
HON. DORIS O. MATSUI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, March 4, 2019
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, it is with
sadness that I rise to recognize the life of the
Honorable Alice Athenia Lytle, who passed
away on December 21, 2018 at 79 years old.
Judge Lytle was not only an incredible leader
as California’s first African-American woman
Superior Court Judge, but as a loved and re-
spected mentor and advocate for children and
families. Today, I ask my colleagues to stand
with me in the memory of her remarkable leg-
acy.
Judge Lytle was born on March 2, 1939 in
Newark, New Jersey as the eighth of ten chil-
dren to Lacey and Margaret Lytle; a family
that was a part of the Great Migration of Afri-
can-Americans north from the Deep South.
She was raised in New York’s Harlem neigh-
borhood, where her passion for advocacy and
social justice was fostered. She studied at
Hunter College in New York City where she
earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in Physi-
ology. She then attended Hastings College of
Law and served as the secretary and presi-
dent of the Black Law Students Association
and was a member of the Student Faculty
Curriculum Committee and Academic Stand-
ards Committee. During her studies, she was
a law clerk for the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People and other at-
torneys in private practice. Ultimately, Judge
Lytle worked with Governor Brown as Chief of
the Industrial Relations’ Division of Fair Em-
ployment Practices with the Department of In-
dustrial Relations and later as the Secretary of
the State Consumer Services Agency.
In 1983, Judge Lytle was appointed by Gov-
ernor Jerry Brown to the Sacramento Munic-
ipal Court and later served as Presiding Judge
of the Municipal Court and Master Calendar
Judge for unlawful detainer matters. Some of
her greatest and most memorable accomplish-
ments are reflected by her time as the Lead
Judicial Officer for juvenile dependency cases.
As Lead Judicial Officer, she created a mentor
program for the youth called the SacraMentor
Program, she established a Healthy Teen
Mothers Program, and served as a mentor for
pregnant teens while working with the Birthing
Project. Significant financial contributions and
services to programs that benefit underprivi-
leged youth are the direct product of her clear
dedication to young people and their well-
being.
Madam Speaker, today we honor the mar-
velous life of Judge Alice Athenia Lytle; an
aunt, a sister, a leader, and beloved public
servant. Alice is a true Sacramento treasure in
our community. She will be remembered for
her courage, kindness, and wisdom.

HON. MICHAEL CLOUD
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, March 4, 2019
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Speaker, I rise today in
remembrance of Jessie Charles Maddix, a
World War II veteran who dedicated his life to
protect his community.
Mr. Maddix was born on May 19, 1923, in
Hudson, Michigan. He served along the coast
of North Carolina in the U.S. Coast Guard.
One of the more memorable moments dur-
ing his time in the Coast Guard happened in
1944 during an Atlantic hurricane. He partici-
pated in a mission that involved a search and
rescue of the liberty ship, George Ade. Prior to
the storm, a German submarine had
torpedoed George Ade off the coast of Cape
Hatteras, North Carolina.
According to the survivors, the hurricane’s
winds reached beyond 100 miles per hour,
and unfortunately, both ships disappeared
amidst the colossal waves. Mr. Maddix was
one of the survivors who withstood the storm
after floating above the surfaces for more than
50 hours.
Later in his life, Mr. Maddix researched his
Native American heritage and became a Chip-
pewa Elder. He traveled to the Saginaw Chip-
pewa Tribal Pow Wow several times in his
90s.
Mr. Maddix’s friends and family will remem-
ber him for his adventures and service to our
nation in the Coast Guard. My heartfelt condo-
lences are with his loved ones during this
time.

his invaluable contributions to the poultry in-

Mr. Massey was recently inducted into the
Poultry Industry Hall of Fame after serving as
president of the Georgia Poultry Federation for
49 years. Often referred to as ‘‘a living leg-

he has worked tirelessly to improve research

decades, making countless improvements and
helping to shape poultry in Georgia and be-

Big League Chew is one of the most fa-
mous bubble gums in the world, and the Ben
Farrar Insurance softball team is on the cover
of the packaging. George Stege, who rep-
resents Big League Chew, and Ben Swanson,
who coaches the girls, formed a friendship
that led to this wonderful debut of girls on the
cover of the packaging where only boys had
been before. The group of teenage girls from
Rock Island helped make this happen by in-
spiring George Stege to take this idea to his
team at Ford Gum Company. Not knowing
that this would be something the company
would consider, given they have such an
iconic logo, the team was excited to hear the
news that they would be the face of Big
League Chew and inspire female athletes ev-
erywhere.
It is because of dedicated leaders such as
George Stege, Ben Swanson and members of

HONORING MS. YU GWAN-SUN
HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR.
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, March 4, 2019
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I rise to
celebrate the outstanding contributions of Yu
Gwan-sun to her country and to the ‘‘March
1st Movement.’’ Her courage united the peo-
ple of South Korea to fight for their freedom
and inspired many to persevere through hard-
ships. Yu passed away upholding her beliefs
and resistance against the colonial rule.
Nine years after the Japanese military rule
of the Korean Peninsula, the push for Korean
independence against Japan began in Seoul
on March 1, 1919. Back then, 16-year-old Yu
Gwan-sun gathered her classmates and
began protesting on the streets. Yu’s efforts
garnered support from many community mem-
bers and she became involved in peaceful stu-
dent demonstrations. The protest, however,
led to the closure of all schools in South
Korea. Yu was briefly detained, and ultimately
forced to return to her hometown, Cheonan.
Yu was not deterred by these obstacles, in-
stead she spread a copy of the United States
Declaration of Independence from town to
town, rallying for support. Her efforts encour-
aged 3,000 citizens to protest on April 1st. Un-
fortunately, during the protest, nineteen people
were shot and killed by the colonial police, in-
cluding Yu’s parents. This sparked a nation-
wide uprising with over two million people par-
ticipating in independence marches. Of the
two million, 700,000 were killed and 46,000
were imprisoned.
Yu was captured, jailed, convicted of sedi-
tion, and sent to Seodaemun Prison in Seoul.
Even in prison, Yu was extremely rebellious.
She demanded the release of other prisoners
and continued to display her support for Ko-
rean Independence. In addition, Yu helped or-
ganize a large-scale protest with other inmates
until she was transferred to an underground
facility where they tortured and killed her.
Yu Gwan-sun’s courage of conviction, even
after countless setbacks, made her the symbol
of Korea’s Independence movement. She in-
spired countless amounts of people to take a
stand for their freedom and sense of self. Al-
though the ‘‘March 1st Movement’’ did not im-
mediately result in Korea’s Independence,
Yu’s presence throughout the protests united
many individuals.
Over 100 years ago, United States Presi-
dent Woodrow Wilson’s ideas of self-deter-
mination to resist the occupation of Japanese
military rule inspired the Korean people. It is
estimated that approximately two million Kore-
ans participated in more than 1,500 dem-
onstrations for independence. These acts be-
came the catalyst for the Korean Independ-
ence movement that would help unify the Ko-
rean people in their quest for independence in
1945.
Our alliance with the Republic of Korea has
always been firm. South Korea has remained
one of the United States’ closest and most
steadfast allies and partners. Our shared be-
lief in self-determination is pivotal to our joint
success and I am proud to rise today to honor
that history. I hope my colleagues will recog-
nize the importance of the Korean March 1st
Movement as a reflection of our own values of
freedom.
The job of a United States Congressman in-
volves much that is rewarding, yet nothing
compares to working with and recognizing the
efforts of dedicated individuals like Ms. Yu
Gwan-sun.
Madam Speaker, I ask that you join our col-
leagues, family, friends and the residents of
the Ninth Congressional District in recognizing,
Ms. Yu Gwan-sun and her outstanding char-
acter and service to her country and commu-
nity.
