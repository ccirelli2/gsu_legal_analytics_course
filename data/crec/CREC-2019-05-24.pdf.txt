COMMUNICATION FROM THE
CLERK OF THE HOUSE
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Clerk of the House of
Representatives:
OFFICE OF THE CLERK,
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
Washington, DC, May 23, 2019.
Hon. NANCY PELOSI,
The Speaker, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: Pursuant to the
permission granted in Clause 2(h) of Rule II
of the Rules of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, the Clerk received the following mes-
sage from the Secretary of the Senate on
May 23, 2019, at 5:31 p.m.:
That the Senate passed S. 151.
That the Senate passed with an amend-
ment H.R. 2157.
With best wishes, I am
Sincerely,
CHERYL L. JOHNSON.
f
SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS
ACT, 2019
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent to take from the
Speaker’s table the bill (H.R. 2157)
making supplemental appropriations
for the fiscal year ending September 30,
2019, and for other purposes, with the
Senate amendment thereto, and concur
in the Senate amendment.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. For
what purpose does the gentleman from
Texas seek recognition?
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, reserving the
right to object, I am here today pri-
marily because if I do not object, Con-
gress will have passed into law a bill
that spends $19 billion of taxpayer
money without Members of Congress
being present here in our Nation’s Cap-
itol to vote on it.
Secondly, it is a bill that includes
nothing to address the clear national
emergency and humanitarian crisis we
face at our southern border.
There is no reason this disaster sup-
plemental should not have included the
quite modest $4.4 billion that Director
of OMB Vought sent to Capitol Hill to
ensure DHS and HHS do not run out of
money—which they are slated to do—
while managing the over 100,000 illegal
aliens crossing our border being appre-
hended, and the unaccompanied alien
minor children being unable to be
housed appropriately.
And, finally, this is a $19 billion bill
that is not paid for when we are
racking up $100 million of debt per
hour. And this is a bipartisan problem,
to be honest, and it is a problem that
we should solve in Congress rather
than ignore.
Our Nation is strong enough and
compassionate enough to have a re-
sponsive and fiscally responsive ap-
proach to help people who are hurting
in the wake of natural disasters.
We have had months to figure this
out and to do our job to secure our bor-
der. And we now are expected to let the
swamp continue to mortgage the fu-
ture of our children and grandchildren,
making it less likely they will inherit
a stronger and better country with a
government capable of defending the
Nation in responding to disasters such
as these.
Mr. Speaker, with that, I respectfully
object.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Objec-
tion is heard.

HONORING BUILDING SAFETY
MONTH
HON. SHARICE DAVIDS
OF KANSAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 24, 2019
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Madam Speaker,
today, during Building Safety Month, I am
pleased to recognize the importance of safety
in the built environment and the dedication of
the members of the International Code Council
(ICC) for their roles in protecting our commu-
nities.
With natural disasters only expected to in-
crease in frequency and severity, building
codes include important safeguards to protect
the public from tornadoes, floods, hurricanes,
snowstorms, wildland fires, and earthquakes.
In January 2019, the congressionally-estab-
lished National Institute of Building Sciences
(NIBS) released a study finding that adopting
modern model building codes save $11 for
every $1 invested through earthquake, flood,
and wind mitigation benefits, with a $4 to $1
wildfire mitigation benefit. These benefits rep-
resent avoided casualties, property damage,
business interruptions, and insurance costs,
and are enjoyed by all building stakeholders—
from developers, titleholders, and lenders, to
tenants and communities.
Vulnerable and underserved populations are
most effected by increases in utility costs. And
they often have the most to lose in the event
of a disaster or health emergency. Building
codes establish minimum requirements that
ensure safe, resilient, and energy efficient
schools, childcare and healthcare facilities,
housing, and places of employment, regard-
less of the income or background of the facili-
ty’s ownership and occupants. These protec-
tions are required by law for public safety, and
enforced by code officials to ensure everyone
enjoys the same protections and plays by the
same rules.
Year round, building safety and fire preven-
tion officials, architects, engineers, builders,
tradespeople, laborers, and others in the con-
struction industry work to ensure the safe con-
struction of buildings though the use of model
building codes. The dedicated members of the
International Code Council, a national stand-
ards developing organization, come together
with local, state and federal officials to develop
voluntary consensus codes that protect Ameri-
cans in the buildings where we worship, live,
work, learn, and play. The International
Codes, the most widely adopted building safe-
ty and fire prevention codes in the nation, are
used by most U.S. cities and counties and in
all 50 states, including the State of Kansas. I
commend the city of Lenexa in my district for
adopting the 2018 International Codes and the
other cities in my district that are undertaking
efforts to update their building codes.
Building Safety Month is sponsored by the
International Code Council to remind the pub-
lic about the critical role of our communities’
code officials in assuring us safe, efficient, and
livable buildings. ‘‘No Code. No Confidence,’’
the theme for Building Safety Month 2019, en-
courages all Americans to raise awareness of
the importance of safe and resilient construc-
tion, fire prevention, disaster mitigation, and
new technologies in the construction industry.
I am honored to recognize International
Code Council Board President William R. Bry-
ant, ICC’s Chief Executive Officer Dominic
Sims, the International Code Council leader-
ship, and ICC’s Members and staff as they
celebrate Building Safety Month.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF
JAMES ERVIN
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 24, 2019
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor the life of Mr. James
Ervin, a Foot Solider in the American Voting
Rights Movement, Vietnam Veteran, and Son
of Selma, Alabama.
An advocate for social justice in every
sense of the word, Mr. Ervin was only sixteen
years old when he dared to participate in Sel-
ma’s voting rights movement. He marched in
many demonstrations and was arrested with
schoolmates in the name of equality and jus-
tice. Mr. Ervin also participated in the infa-
mous march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge
in Selma on Bloody Sunday, coverage of
which helped contribute to the passage of the
Voting Rights Act of 1965. Upon graduation
from high school, Mr. Ervin continued his
record of public service and sacrifice by enlist-
ing in the United States Army and serving our
country honorably in the Vietnam War.
Mr. James ‘‘Ebo’’ Ervin was born in Selma,
Alabama, on October 27, 1948, and he de-
parted this life on Monday, May 13, 2019, in
Mobile, Alabama. He was preceded in death
by his father Willie Ervin; his mother, Willie
Lee Ervin (née: Goodwin); and his brother Al-
bert ‘‘Joe’’ Ervin.
Mr. Ervin was in high school during the civil
rights movement in the Selma-Montgomery
area. He actively participated in the events of
the time with the hopes of changing the area
and the nation. He has been recognized as an
original Foot Soldier of the movement. Mr.
Ervin went on to graduate from R.B. Hudson
High School in May 1967. He faithfully at-
tended class reunions and maintained lifelong
friendships with his classmates. Shortly after
graduation, Mr. Ervin joined the U.S. Army
and served our nation during the Vietnam
War.
After returning home to Selma, he attended
and graduated from Wallace Community Col-
lege where he received an Associate Degree
in Industrial Electricity in October 1974. After
graduation, he relocated to Mobile, Alabama,
where he began working in various shipyards
around the Gulf Coast area. He was employed
with Bender Shipbuilding for 10 years then
went on to work for Ingalls Shipbuilding, where
he worked for 27 years until his retirement.
Mr. Ervin accepted Christ as his Savior at
an early age. His personal relationship with
the Lord was very important to him and he
was always encouraging others to work on
their own personal relationship with God. He
joined Mt. Zion Primitive Baptist Church in
Selma and considered it to be his home
church, but he was also an active member of
New Faith Baptist Church in Mobile, Alabama,
where he was in regular attendance and
served the church as needed.
Mr. Ervin was the youngest of Willie and
Willie Lee’s seven children. He is survived by
his siblings: Willie (Gloria) Ervin, Jr., Maggie
Harris, Charles Ervin, Mary Lee, and Solomon
(Joan) Ervin.
After the passing of his mother Willie Lee
Ervin, James was blessed to be welcomed
into the family of Lula Marie Edwards. She
embraced him as her son and he loved her as
his mother.
Along with Lula, Mr. Ervin is mourned by his
siblings: Brenda (Steven) Brazzelle, Anthony
Edwards, Amy (Roosevelt) Marzette, Steph-
anie (Ricky) Menifee, Lewis (Lisa) Edwards,
Bonita (Calvin) Andrews, and Derrick
Edwards, and half siblings, Solomon ‘‘TC’’
Ervin, Gloria Walker, and Raymond Walker.
Mr. Ervin shared unique and special rela-
tionships with each of his 16 siblings and his
relationships with his children and grand-
children were no different. He leaves seven
children to cherish his memories: Grace
(Tommy) Johnson, Glenda Reaves, Barry
Lowe, Elecia Scott, Ericka Priester, James
Levan (La’Shell) Peasant, and Christopher
Charles Peasant; twelve grandchildren:
Tomequa (Norris, Jr.) Lewis, Tierra Robinson,
Christopher Reaves, Brandon Bennett, Jailynn
Peasant, Zyia Peasant, Janeá Scott, Tobiasz
Johnson, Tommasz Johnson, Jaichelle Peas-
ant, Elisha Brayden Scott, and Jaceyon Alex-
ander Long; two great grandchildren, Madisyn
Lewis and Tamari Jacob Smith; a host of
nieces, nephews, cousins, and friends, includ-
ing one devoted sister Maggie Harris, a de-
voted niece, Franchy Harris Coleman; and
special friends, Joseph Smitherman, Calvin
Thomas, and Robert Hatcher.
On behalf of Alabama’s 7th Congressional
District and a grateful nation, I ask my col-
leagues to join me in celebrating Mr. Ervin’s
contributions to bettering the Selma and Mo-
bile communities and our nation.

Action Framework.
The University joins other prominent sport-
ing organizations such as the Olympic Com-
mittee, FIFA and the NBA to establish a clear
path for the world’s sporting communities to
fight climate change.
The University of Colorado’s Athletic Pro-
gram has committed to reducing overall cli-
mate impact, educating others on climate ac-
tion, promoting sustainable consumption, ad-
vocating for climate action and promoting envi-
ronmental responsibility.
This is leadership.
This is not the first time that my state and
my district have picked up the slack for where
the federal government is falling short on cli-
mate action. Our constituents are acting on
this issue, and it’s about time we follow their
lead. I am incredibly proud of my University
and of my community for their leadership on
climate change and commend their efforts to
be the change they want to see in the world.

RECOGNIZING THE LEGACY OF
BOB BERG
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 24, 2019
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, it is with great
honor that we recognize the legacy of Bob
Berg, a communications professional and
long-time public servant in the city of Detroit.
Born April 1, 1943, in Watseka, Illinois, Mr.
Berg grew up on farms in central Illinois and
went on to earn his bachelor’s degree in polit-
ical science from Wesleyan University where
he wrote for the student paper. After grad-
uating, Mr. Berg held several positions, includ-
ing leading the state capitol bureau for United
Press International covering Governor William
G. Milliken. He was later hired in the Public
Affairs office of Milliken.
In 1982, Mr. Berg went on to the role for
which he is most well-known, serving as press
secretary for Detroit Mayor Coleman A.
Young. Mr. Berg’s professionalism and work
ethic earned him his reputation for being an
exceptional press secretary. He served on
Mayor Young’s staff for eleven years, touching
on many issues that faced Detroiters.
Beyond his time serving under Mayor
Young, Mr. Berg began his own communica-
tions firm. He was honored by New Detroit in
2014 with a Leadership in Race Relations
award and by the Detroit Urban League in
2018 as a Distinguished Warrior. Mr. Berg
served on several organizations, including on
the board of the Coleman A. Young Founda-
tion, the Detroit Police Foundation, and the
Detroit Urban League.
It is with great sadness that we recognize
the great loss of Bob Berg and give tribute to
his surviving family.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF
CHARLES B. SEIDEL
HON. JOHN KATKO
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 24, 2019
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in
memory of Charles B. Seidel, a devoted public
servant and loving husband and father. On
May 7, 2019, Mr. Seidel passed away at the
age of 62 while on a business trip. Mr. Seidel
had an outstanding 26-year career with the
Central Intelligence Agency, overseeing agen-
cy operations throughout several conflicts, be-
fore entering private life in 2006.
Charles Seidel was born on June 29, 1956
in Alexandria, Virginia, to his parents John and
Annette Seidel. His father was a senior CIA
officer who inspired his son to follow in his
footsteps. Shortly after graduating from Drew
University, Mr. Seidel joined his father at the
CIA in 1980.
Mr. Seidel spent most of his CIA tenure in
the Middle East, holding various leadership
roles in Iraq, Kuwait, and North African na-
tions. As Chief of Station for the CIA’s Middle
East Station, he provided intelligence support
in the efforts to end Saddam Hussein’s 1990
invasion of Kuwait and once again in 2003 to
overthrow the Hussein-led regime in Iraq. Mr.
Seidel possessed a deep respect for the his-
tory and customs of the Middle East, which
helped him collaborate with the citizens and
governments in the region.
In 2006, Mr. Seidel retired from the CIA and
worked for private security consultants such
as Decapolis LLC, Blackfish Group, Command
Global Services, Strategic Risk Management,
and Lazarus Brothers. He was awarded two
Intelligence Stars for valor during his service
with the agency and was well-respected by his
peers.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in celebrating the life of Charles B. Seidel.
He was a committed public servant who al-
ways strived to keep America safe from mali-
cious foreign actors. Additionally, the level of
respect he showed for other cultures was sec-
ond to none and serves as an honorable
standard for all Americans.
f
RECOGNIZING THE UNVEILING OF
THE NEWLY RENAMED ‘‘MUHAM-
MAD ALI WAY’’
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO
OF ARIZONA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 24, 2019
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, it is my
privilege to honor the contributions of one of
our country’s greatest boxers, activists, and
philanthropists as my district celebrates the
unveiling of the newly renamed street ‘‘Mu-
hammad Ali Way’’ this June 3rd—the three-
year anniversary of Muhammad Ali’s passing
in Scottsdale in 2016—thanks to the initiative
of Dignity Health.
I want to recognize something more than
the endurance with which Ali inspired us each
time he entered the ring. The athleticism, de-
termination, and honor he brought to the sport
of boxing are commendable. But the endur-
ance he sustained outside the ring after he
was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in
1984 has been a true inspiration to the
world—and to the people of Phoenix in par-
ticular, where he and his neurologist Abraham
Lieberman helped establish the Muhammad
Ali Parkinson Center (MAPC) at Barrow Neu-
rological Institute in 1997. The center has
grown over the past two decades into an inter-
nationally renowned facility for Parkinson’s dis-
ease and movement disorder related medical
care. MAPC continues to carry out Muham-
mad and Lonnie Ali’s mission each day to pro-
vide high-quality and compassionate treat-
ment, education, and support to every indi-
vidual battling Parkinson’s disease, to their
caregivers, and to their families.
The team of neurologists, nurses, physical
therapists, occupational therapists, and
speech-language pathologists at MAPC sees
more than 1,200 patients a year. It is through
the Ali family’s continued support and devotion
to driving the world towards a cure for Parkin-
son’s disease that the center is able to main-
tain robust outreach programs to patients and
families, and serve Arizonans with palliative
care, remote-telemedicine appointments, and
other critical services.
It is fitting, then, that the road leading to the
center also be named in recognition of Ali’s
contributions: his demonstration of American
tenacity and spirit in sport, in his battle with
Parkinson’s, in his support of the advance-
ment of medical research, in his service to the
Phoenix community, and in his service to our
country as a whole. I look forward to traveling
down the newly renamed ‘‘Muhammad Ali
Way’’ each time I have the opportunity to visit
the Muhammad Ali Parkinson Center in Phoe-
nix for years to come.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF
STAFF SGT. JOHN SIMONETTI
HON. THOMAS R. SUOZZI
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 24, 2019
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the memory of Staff Sgt. John
Simonetti, who sacrificed his life for his coun-
try 75 years ago.
Simonetti was born in Jackson Heights,
New York on May 24th, 1918. He later en-
listed in the United States Army as a Staff
Sergeant in the 2nd Infantry Division. On D-
Day plus 1, Staff Sgt. Simonetti’s division
crossed the Channel with the mission to cap-
ture an enemy strong point, a city called Saint-
Lô, Normandy. On June 16, 1944, Simonetti
was killed in action during an ambush by
enemy troops outside the town of St. Germain
d’Elle. Under heavy fire, his squad was forced
to abandon his body and was unable to locate
it when they returned to the area days later.
In the absence of a body to mourn, Staff
Sgt. Simonetti’s family carried with them the
memory of a kind, funny, patriotic young man
and passed along the story of his sacrifice to
younger generations. On the 50th anniversary
of D-Day, Simonetti’s nephew, Fred Salerno,
travelled to Normandy to learn more about his
uncle and St. Germain d ’Elle. There, Salerno
met with locals from the area and left with
them his contact information should any re-
mains be discovered.
15 years later, the skeletal remains of an
American soldier—with dog tags still around
his neck—were unearthed near the center of
town and officials, remembering the family
who had visited years earlier, contacted
Salerno. Staff Sgt. Simonetti’s remains were
flown to the United States and laid to rest in
Arlington National Cemetery.
I believe the story of Staff Sgt. Simonetti’s
sacrifice, his family’s longstanding dedication
to his memory, and the people of St. Germain

d’Elle’s respect for a fallen American soldier
are indicative of some of the best traits of the
human race. A man lost his life 75 years ago
fighting for freedom and liberty, and two com-
munities that he touched were brought to-
gether in friendship and fraternity.
As we near Memorial Day, it becomes ever
more important for us to recognize and share
these stories of our brave soldiers who never
returned home. I hope all Americans remem-
ber the fallen soldiers who committed the
greatest sacrifice of giving their lives for our

IN MEMORY OF ROY APPLETON,
JR.
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 24, 2019
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in memory of Mr. Roy Appleton, Jr., who
passed away on Monday, April 8, 2019 after
a lifetime of service to our nation and his
North Texas neighbors.
As a young man, Roy Appleton, Jr. served
in the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II.
He saw combat action for more than 35
months in the South Pacific, taking part in the
invasion of Iwo Jima and fighting in multiple
battles including the retaking Guadalcanal and
Saipan.
Upon his return home to Texas, Mr. Apple-
ton married Margie Lee Monroe of Denton in
1947. He earned a degree from the University
of North Texas in 1949. Even before he grad-
uated, Mr. Appleton began working at the
Denton Record-Chronicle. He was employed
by the paper for more than four decades, retir-
ing in 1991 as president and general man-
ager. Aside from his service in the U.S. Ma-
rine Corps, Mr. Appleton spent his entire ca-
reer at the paper.
An engaged community leader, Mr. Apple-
ton served in a variety of leadership roles for
the Denton Chamber of Commerce, the Den-
ton Economic Development Advisory Board,
and United Way of Denton County. He was an
active member of the Denton Rotary Club and
Denton Jaycees, as well as a director of First
State Bank and a ruling elder at St. Andrew
Presbyterian Church.
In 2014, the Greater Denton Arts Council re-
named their home the ‘‘Patterson-Applegate
Center for the Visual Arts’’ in recognition of
Mr. Appleton’s contributions to the art culture
of Denton County, which include the creation
of the Campus Theatre, annual Holiday Light-
ing Festival and Denton Arts & Jazz Festival.
In recognition of his many contributions to
the North Texas community, the Greater Den-
ton Arts Council (GDAC) will honor Mr. Apple-
ton’s legacy of philanthropy and civic engage-
ment at its annual awards event on May 31,
2019.
I am grateful for Mr. Appleton’s many dec-
ades of selfless service to our nation and our
community. On behalf of the 26th District of
Texas, I offer my condolences to his family,
friends, and neighbors.
GOLD STAR FAMILIES
HON. KEVIN HERN
OF OKLAHOMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 24, 2019
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Madam
Speaker, to many Americans, this 3-day week-
end is an excuse to take a trip, go to the pool,
barbeque, and celebrate the start of summer.
But to millions of Americans, it’s the reminder
of the sacrifices that our military men and
women make every single day to preserve our
country’s freedoms.
No one understands that sacrifice better
than Gold Star Families.
The Gold Star Legacy is an organization
that honors the memory of our fallen heroes
by supporting their families and raising aware-
ness of the struggles that military families go
through.
The sacrifices and struggles of military fami-
lies are often overlooked on these holidays,
but their sacrifices are just as important to the
protection of our country as the ones made by
those who answer the call to serve.
This Memorial Day, I am grateful for the
dedication and sacrifices not only from our
military, but also from their families, especially
the families of our fallen heroes. I send my
sincerest respect and sympathy to our Gold
Star Families today.
I encourage all Americans to take some
time this weekend to reflect on the men and
women who bravely serve, the heroes we’ve
lost and the families they left behind.

CONGRATULATING MR. JOHN
CORONA ON HIS RETIREMENT
HON. MARK TAKANO
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 24, 2019
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor and congratulate John Corona who
will be retiring after serving the Riverside Uni-
fied School District for 40 years.
Mr. Corona’s tenure in education has left a
lasting impact on the Riverside community. He
received numerous awards throughout the du-
ration of his career, which demonstrate the ad-
miration his colleagues and students have for
him.
One of Mr. Corona’s proudest achievements
was the creation of ‘‘King High School Re-
members.’’ This annual project sparked contin-
uous outreach to the veteran community and
began an important dialogue between vet-
erans and students. Since 2001, more than
300 veterans have been interviewed by high
school students.
Above all, Mr. Corona touched the lives of
hundreds of students through his teaching,
coaching, and mentorship. I send him best
wishes on his well-deserved retirement and
thank him for his service to our community.
VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS
JAMES DALY POST 200 100TH AN-
NIVERSARY
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 24, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
commemorate the Veterans of Foreign Wars
James Daly Post 200 in Hastings-on-Hudson
as they celebrate their 100th anniversary. Our
veterans truly are our nation’s greatest heroes.
For a century now, Post 200 in Hastings has
been an invaluable center and resource for
veterans in my Congressional District, and has
provided a strong sense of community for its
members.
Post 200’s exemplary commitment to vet-
erans and the community is truly inspiring.
Their annual Memorial Day parade in Hastings
is a staple of the community that year after
year does a beautiful job of honoring our serv-
ice members. The event brings veterans,
friends, families, and community members to-
gether from across my district to remember
those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our
nation.
Members of James Daly Post 200 risked
their lives to serve our country overseas. I am
thankful for their service, and the vital role
Post 200 plays in connecting veterans
throughout my district. It is my absolute honor
to commemorate their centennial anniversary.

NATIONAL STOP THE BLEED DAY
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, May 24, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to mark National Stop the Bleed Day.
More than 200,000 Americans lose their lives
every year from traumatic incidents, including
shootings, vehicular crashes, and workplace
accidents When injuries involve traumatic
blood loss, death can occur in as little as five
minutes. These deaths, however, are often-
times preventable.
National Stop the Bleed Day is a day to
raise awareness of how to respond to severe
bleeding incidents. Just as people learn CPR
so that they can help a person having a heart
attach, or the Heimlich maneuver for when
someone is choking, learning how to respond
to a traumatic bleeding incident can be the dif-
ference between life and death while waiting
for professional help to arrive.
This month, my colleague Dr. BRAD
WENSTRUP (R–OH) and I introduced H.R.
2550, the Prevent Blood Loss with Emergency
Equipment Devices Act of 2019 (the Prevent
BLEEDing Act), to provide this lifesaving train-
ing and expand access to Bleeding Control
Kits (BCKs). This legislation will help place
tens of thousands of emergency blood loss
prevention materials in schools, places of wor-
ship, and other public gathering places across
the country, so that if disaster strikes, bystand-
ers can be better equipped to respond. I ask
my colleagues to support this effort and work
with me to ensure its speedy passage.

GLOBAL ELECTORAL EXCHANGE
ACT OF 2019
SPEECH OF
HON. MARK MEADOWS
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, May 20, 2019
Mr. MEADOWS. Madam Speaker, fair, trust-
worthy, and accountable elections are critical
to defending freedom among our international
partners and are fundamental to our identity
as a nation. The professionalism of election
administrators globally is essential for pre-
serving democracy across the world. The
Global Electoral Exchange Act gives America
a new tool to use in this important work by
sending election administrators and officials,
including government officials, polling workers,
civil society representatives, members of the
judiciary, and others who participate in the or-
ganization and administration of an election
and other American experts abroad to
strengthen new democracies and share best
practices.
Under our bill, those responsible for admin-
istering elections outside of the United States
could also come here, observing our own
processes and taking valuable lessons back
home. By keeping the world safe for our basic
values we also help stave off the violence in
at-risk democracies that all too often follows
poorly-run, unfree elections and that often
benefits those would do our nation harm. Put
simply, American citizens and businesses are
safer when we strengthen good governance
and freedom in the world’s democracies.
I want to thank my friend and colleague
JOAQUIN CASTRO for working with me on this
bill in both the 115th and the 116th Con-
gresses, and I applaud his bipartisan leader-
ship and hard work on this important issue.
