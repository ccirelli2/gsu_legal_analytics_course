TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF PAT
WOOTON
HON. HAROLD ROGERS
OF KENTUCKY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, December 13, 2019
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to pay tribute to the memory of a
long-time friend and advisor, Mr. Dennis Pat-
rick ‘‘Pat’’ Wooton, one of Buckhorn, Ken-
tucky’s most beloved sons. His experience in
education, law enforcement, coaching, local
government operations and politics made him
one of the most well-known and well-versed
leaders in the Kentucky River area. It was his
charming, encouraging and quick-witted per-
sonality that enabled him to become an instant
friend to everyone he met along the way, and
I count myself blessed to have been a part of
his expansive friendship circle.
When I needed someone to transition field
operations in Eastern Kentucky from my Con-
gressional Office in Hazard, Pat Wooton was
my top choice. As the former Pen-y County
Sheriff, Pat was one of the first leaders in law
enforcement to partner with Operation UNITE.
He was determined to impact the prescription
drug abuse epidemic that first ravaged our re-
gion 20 years ago. During a time when the
stigma surrounding drug abuse paralyzed our
communities, Pat stood strong in the face of
adversity, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with
Operation UNITE to save lives and transform
our region.
No one knew or loved the intricate facets of
Perry County and life in the mountains, more
than he did. As my Eastern Kentucky field
man, Pat worked directly with local leaders
across more than a dozen counties, bridging
communications and funding resources for
vital projects like infrastructure expansions,
roadway enhancements, local emergency dis-
aster response, economic development
projects, and much more. His advocacy for im-
proving communities in Eastern Kentucky was
inspiring. When Pat entered a meeting, no one
had to guess where he was from, because the
City of Buckhorn was always at the top of his
list for project needs. Naturally, when he re-
tired from his post in my Congressional office,
he served as mayor of his hometown.
Pat thrived on serving others throughout his
entire life, starting in the Vietnam War, when
the U.S. Anny honored him with several serv-
ice medals, including the Bronze Star. After
returning to American soil, he dedicated his
service to educating and coaching students at
Buckhorn High School, where he became one
of the most highly respected and loved prin-
cipals in the school’s history. He took edu-
cation to a new level, focusing as much on
mentoring and inspiring young people, as he
did teaching textbook material.
Whether he was serving on local community
boards, coaching young athletes, enhancing
education and law enforcement in one of the
most rural parts of the country, or simply
meeting someone for the first time, Pat
Wooton made a lasting impression on every-
one he encountered. His ability to recite mem-
orable Eastern Kentucky expressions stirred
many smiles and laughs over the years
among friends and associates.
As we remember our dear friend, may we
carry forward Pat’s legacy of service and kind-
ness in the years to come. My wife, Cynthia
and I, extend our deepest sympathy to his
wife, Veda, their children, grandchildren, and
all those who were blessed to know and love
such a great man.

HONORING ROBERT H. DOWN

learning environment with an educational phi-
losophy that emphasizes academic enrichment
through community engagement and individ-
ualized learning objectives, catered to the
emotional, social, and academic needs of
each of its students. In addition to a rigorous
academic curriculum, Robert Down Elemen-
tary features programs that promote learning
in social-emotional studies, character develop-
ment, STEAM (Science, Technology, Engi-
neering, Art, Mathematics), foreign languages,
vocal and instrumental music, journalism, vis-
ual/performing arts, and other subjects to pro-
vide students with a robust and multifaceted
learning experience.
In 2018, with the help of dedicated staff,
courageous leadership, supportive family, and
engaged community, all students and signifi-
cant student groups scored in the highest
band of academic performance for both
English Language Arts and Mathematics on
the California Assessment of Student Perform-
ance and Progress—a testament to Robert
Down School’s deep commitment to fostering
a comprehensive, transformative learning ex-
perience for all of its students.
Robert Down School is setting the bar for
academic intervention programs across the
country. The intervention program, which is
fluid and adapts to students’ individual needs,
works both within the general education class-
room and outside the core curricula time, in
the community and at home, to ensure that all
students are set on a path of academic suc-
cess. Students enter reading, writing, and/or
mathematics intervention based on diagnostic
information, analysis of assessments, evalua-
tion of the student’s daily performance in the
classroom, and teacher consultation. Students
are given benchmark assessments three times
a year and are provided with monthly progress
monitoring to ensure the program’s criteria is
responsive to the ever-evolving needs of its
students.
The teachers and staff at Robert Down
School are deeply committed to developing
bright and high-achieving students. Madam
Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in
recognizing the achievement and hard work of
Robert H. Down Elementary School and their
well-deserved recognition as a 2019 National
Blue Ribbon School.

HONORING COMMANDER MICHAEL
D. CASSADY
HON. STEVE STIVERS
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, December 13, 2019
Mr. STIVERS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the work of a public servant who has
spent his life in service to our country, Com-
mander Michael D. Cassady. On March 1,
2020 he will retire from the United States
Navy after nearly thirty-five years of active
duty service.
Commander Cassady, a native of
Millersport, Ohio, began his military career at
the Naval Training Center, San Diego, Cali-
fornia as a Seaman Recruit. During tours in
the Philippines, Diego Garcia, Maryland, and
Connecticut, Commander Cassady also dedi-
cated time to pursue off-duty education at the
University of Maryland, University College in
1991. He then received his commission as an
Ensign, Medical Service Corps, United States
Navy in 1993. Commander Cassady utilized
his degree to better his community by sup-
porting the health of his fellow
servicemembers during tours in Iceland,
Japan, Thailand, Australia, and Virginia.
In 2006, Commander Cassady deployed to
Baghdad, Iraq to support combat operations
as the Civil Affairs Public Health Section Lead,
Multi-National Division. He later embarked on
two tours of duty as the Environmental Health
Officer, U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba and U.S. Naval Hospital Naples, Italy.
A firm believer in the importance of edu-
cation, Commander Cassady earned a Master
of Science in Management from Troy State
University, a Master of Public Health from The
Ohio State University, a Master of Arts in Na-
tional Security and Strategy from the Naval
War College, and a Master of Science in Edu-
cation from Old Dominion University.
He and his family have made incredible sac-
rifices and contributions in defense of our
great nation. Endless support comes from his
wife Rohini, and their children Rhyan,
Kassandra, Briana, and David, and we owe
them an additional debt of gratitude.
There is no doubt his contributions have
made our community, Ohio, and our nation a
better place. I offer my congratulations, and
sincere appreciation, to Commander Cassady
for his service. I wish him all the best in his
next chapter.

INTRODUCTION OF THE FAA
FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, December 13, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to introduce the FAA family and Medical
Leave Act. This legislation will ensure that em-
ployees of the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) are extended the same paid parental
leave benefits afforded to other government
employees under the conference report for the
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for
Fiscal Year 2020.
The conference report to the NDAA, which
was announced earlier this week and passed
in the House of Representatives Wednesday
evening, secured a critical provision for federal
employees that will provide 12 weeks of paid
parental leave in the case of birth, adoption, or
fostering. The provision will help the federal
government retain talent and remain competi-
tive with private industry.
Unfortunately, this section was drafted to
apply to Title 5 only, which has resulted in
FAA employees being left out of this very im-
portant benefit. More than 35,000 federal em-
ployees across our nation are responsible for
managing air traffic control, aircraft, and air-
port safety. I believe we must move quickly to
address this oversight and ensure that FAA
employees receive the paid parental leave
benefits they rightly deserve under the NDAA
agreement.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to introduce
this measure and urge this body to provide for
its immediate consideration.

IN HONOR OF ALFRED PRESTON
‘‘WHITEY’’ BIRDWELL’S 101ST
BIRTHDAY
HON. KEVIN BRADY
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, December 13, 2019
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, today I rise to
recognize and celebrate the 101st birthday of
a remarkable Purple Heart recipient and out-
standing member of the Eighth Congressional
District of Texas, Mr. Alfred Birdwell, or
‘‘Whitey.’’
Born on November 18, 1918, Whitey was
the second of six boys in his family and grew
up on a farm in Minden, Texas. He had a tra-
ditional East Texas upbringing, from growing
crops and raising animals to hunting with his
family. Though he traveled the world while
training for and serving in World War II,
Whitey has remained a lifelong Texan.
In 1940, Whitey married his first wife, Edith
Husband. Together, they had two children be-
fore basic training. While at training in 1945,
he received a letter that their infant child,
Jimmy, was sick and passed away. He went
home to help his family through the tragic loss
and returned to training more motivated than
ever to serve his country. Edith and Whitey
would end up having seven beautiful children
together before Edith’s passing on August 8,
1960.
Whitey began his service in the Army on
May 26, 1944. He served as a Medium Tank
Crewman to the 3rd Armored Division, 3rd
Regiment and drove the lead tank. Whitey
quickly became known for his quick wit and
expert rifle skills, and soon became friends
with his commanding officer, Colonel
Lovelady, who he was charged with protecting
during battle. The two bonded over morning
coffee and would often joke, ‘‘Do you think this
cup will carry us to Berlin?’’
Whitey earned the nickname ‘‘Crazy Texan’’
for his actions under fire throughout his serv-
ice. During a mortar barrage, his assistant
tank driver sat up out of the tank to try to get
a better vantage point but was instead hit by
the incoming fire. Whitey grabbed him and
ducked into a foxhole, getting hit by the mortar
barrage himself. Stubborn and hard-headed as
ever, he insisted on fighting although he was
wounded. Whitey was sent to the hospital
after the battle, and was later awarded a Pur-
ple Heart for the incident.
In the 1960s, Whitey worked in Texas City.
While dining at a local restaurant, he met
Patsy Grimes. The two married later that year
and blended their families, raising their 11 chil-
dren in one household. Although the family
was large and the house was always hectic,
life as a Birdwell was full of love and laughter.
Shortly after celebrating their 50th wedding
anniversary in 2015, Patsy fell ill and passed
away.
Anyone that knows Whitey can testify that
he’s never lost his energetic spirit. Last year,
he decided to celebrate his 100th birthday
walking a mile. The event garnered so much
attention that he decided to turn his birthday
celebration into a charity event, and success-
fully raised hundreds of dollars for the Blinded
Veterans Association and the Brazos Valley
Veterans Memorial, two causes close to his
heart.
His service to our country, compassion for
others and joy for life serves as true example
for us all. I am proud to join his 18 grand-
children, 46 great grandchildren, 9 great great
grandchildren, and the entire Eighth Congres-
sional District of Texas in wishing Whitey a
happy 101st birthday.

ANITA SMITH—AN AMAZING HERO
IN THE GLOBAL FIGHT AGAINST
HIV–AIDS
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, December 13, 2019
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker,
Anita Smith is a woman who has made a re-
markable and lasting contribution to the global
battle against HIV/AIDS, who along with her
husband, Shepherd, was instrumental in ral-
lying the faith-based community—in particular,
evangelical Christians—to the cause.
She has been heralded as an ‘‘early voice’’
within the Christian community calling for the
need to bring God’s love and tangible assist-
ance to those stricken by a disease which all
too often—particularly in the developing
world—led to a wasting away of the body, a
social ostracism and a lonely death.
Anita began her HIV/AIDS work in 1986 with
Americans for a Sound AIDS/HIV Policy,
which became the Children’s AIDS Fund in
1996. Vulnerable children were a special focus
of her ministry, and to give one example of
that, in one year alone her Holiday Gift Pro-
gram sent over 10,000 presents to AIDS-im-
pacted kids living here in the United States.
Knowing that the call to be one’s brother’s
keeper knows no boundries, Anita expanded
her work overseas, particularly to Africa. Hav-
ing become the President of Children’s AIDS
Fund International—or CAFl—in 1996, she
opened CAFI’s first clinic in Africa in 2002. Ul-
timately she established fifteen clinics in
Uganda, South Africa, Zambia and Malawi.
Serving along with Louis Sullivan as the co-
chair of President George W. Bush’s Presi-
dent’s Advisory Council for HIV/AIDS from
2002 to 2006, Anita was also there—and a te-
nacious advocate—when President Bush un-
dertook one of his greatest lifeworks, the
United States President’s Emergency Plan for
AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. Anita was not only
instrumental in garnering Christian support for
PEPFAR, but in many respects helped lead
the way, as her Africa work was already a
shining example of how the faith-based com-
munity was effectively responding to the global
pandemic.
At that time I was serving as chairman of
the House Foreign Affairs Africa and Global
Health subcommittee, and I saw first hand
Anita’s passion, wisdom, efficacy and commit-
ment. Hers was the voice of wise counsel and
compassion, which helped guide not only the
White House, USAID and Congress but my
subcommittee as well as we oversaw the work
of PEPFAR and USAID.
In 2006, my wife Marie and I joined Anita
and Shepherd and Marilyn and Ray Ruddy on
a trip to Uganda and we saw firsthand how
her work was helping to prevent HIV for many
while bringing healing and hope to those in-
fected.
Today, those clinics which Anita founded
serve over 100,000 HIV patients. Anita’s clin-
ics have had a reputation for the high reten-
tion of patients, high engagement of males—
which is oftentimes a hard-to-reach segement
of the population in Africa—high adherence to
courses of medication treatment and high mo-
rale.
In sum, more than simply being an early
voice, Anita’s was a powerful voice which con-
sistently responded ‘‘Here I am, Lord,’’—I am
available—when she heard the appeal ‘‘Whom
shall I send?’’
Anita’s lifework is an exemplification of Mat-
thew 25—‘‘when I was sick you looked after
me.’’
Anita Smith is an amazing hero in the global
fight against HIV/AIDS.
Thank you—I say again thank you—Anita.

Mr. STIVERS. Madam Speaker, I rise today

and Air Force, ultimately earning the rank of
E–8. I extend my appreciation to Mr. Plummer
for his sacrifices in order to protect our free-
doms in Alaska, Seoul, and Da Nang during
World War II, the Korean War, and the Viet-
nam War.
Following this extensive service, Mr. Plum-
mer continued to dedicate his time and energy
to support his fellow veterans by volunteering
with the Department of Veterans Affairs Vol-
untary Service Program for over thirty-seven
years. From his time as a Veterans Affairs
Voluntary Service Representative, Mr. Plum-
mer has spent over 11,000 hours going be-
yond the call of duty to help others lead mean-
ingful lives.
To quantify Mr. Plummer’s impact is nearly
impossible. His enthusiasm is contagious, his
determination and dedication to service is in-
spiring to all those he meets. I can say, with-
out a doubt, that all of Ohio, our nation, our
world is a better place because of his leader-
ship.
I wish to congratulate Mr. Harlan Frank
Plummer on his 100th birthday and convey my
most sincere appreciation for his service to
our nation.
