God, our Father, we give You thanks
for giving us another day.
Bless the Members of the people’s

greater honor and glory.
Amen.

lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

THANKING MRS. KATHLEEN
MIRABILE
(Mr. PAPPAS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize my high school U.S.
history teacher, Kathleen Mirabile,
who retired last week after serving the
Manchester School District for 49
years, 42 of those at my alma mater of
Central High School.
Mrs. Mirabile is a Central High insti-
tution, and her passion for her subject
matter and dedication to her profession
made her an exemplary teacher. She
was a longtime leader of the social
studies department and the National
Honor Society.
She gave back to her community in
many ways, including leading efforts
locally to preserve and share the his-
tory of Manchester.
Mrs. Mirabile knows that history is
not simply a collection of dates, facts
and figures; it is about people. We must
understand it or be bound to repeat it.
I think of her lessons on a regular
basis, and so do thousands of New
Hampshire students who have walked
through her classroom doors.
On behalf of the people of New Hamp-
shire’s First District, I thank Mrs. Mi-
rabile for incredible service and wish
her the best in her well-deserved retire-
ment.
f
THANKING RICHARD SCHAFER
(Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker,
last month, I proudly introduced legis-
lation, H.R. 2695, to name Success
Dam, located in Tulare County, Cali-
fornia, after Mr. Richard L. Schafer, a
longtime Tule River Water Master.
Last week, I was pleased to see this bill
pass the House of Representatives by
unanimous consent.
For decades, Mr. Schafer has dem-
onstrated unparalleled commitment to
ensuring our families, farms, and com-
munities get the water they need to
live and work. A major part of this
commitment includes this yearlong
persistence to enlarge Lake Success.
Doing so, would increase flood protec-
tion to communities and farmlands
that are below the dam. But as Cali-
fornia knows, more water storage
means more security for the inevitable
times of a drought that put a strain on
our lives.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5010 June 21, 2019
The good news for Tulare County is
that, in 2018, the Army Corps of Engi-
neers fully funded work to raise the
dam. I stand here today to state with
confidence that, without Mr. Schafer’s
leadership, this project might not have
been approved.
This is because no matter how con-
tentious water issues can get—and if
you are in California, you know that
can be quite contentious—Mr. Schafer
has always been the consummate pro-
fessional, always remaining even-
keeled, results-focused. It is only ap-
propriate and fitting that Success Dam
be named after Mr. Schafer.
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my
colleagues in this Chamber for coming
together and acknowledging the indi-
viduals who work hard and make our
communities better.
Most importantly, I want to thank
Mr. Schafer for his continued leader-
ship and service to our community.
This is a much-deserved honor.
f
REMEMBERING FRANK WILLS AND
HONORING HIS MEMORY
(Mr. EVANS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the hero who has
too often been forgotten; Frank Wills
is his name, the security guard who
discovered the Watergate burglary in
progress.
Mr. Wills’ discovery ultimately led to
the exposure of crimes and scandalous
behavior by several members of the
Nixon administration and campaign,
including the President himself.
Despite his central role in exposing
that Presidential scandal, Mr. Wills
only received a 3 percent raise in his
weekly salary, and his work at the Wa-
tergate actually hurt his later efforts
to find a new job.
Unfortunately, Mr. Wills passed away
at the age of 52 without receiving the
type of official recognition he deserved.
This week, we observed the anniver-
sary of the Watergate break-in, and on
behalf of the Congressional Black Cau-
cus, I urge everyone to remember Mr.
Wills and honor his memory.
f
ALZHEIMER’S AND BRAIN
AWARENESS MONTH
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, June is Alzheimer’s
and Brain Awareness Month.
Alzheimer’s is the sixth leading cause
of death in the United States, and it
has reached crisis proportions. There is
no effective treatment and no means of
prevention and no method for slowing
the progression of this disease. Sadly,
one in three seniors will die of the dis-
ease of Alzheimer’s.
Today, on the longest day of the
year, the Alzheimer’s Association is
raising awareness to outshine the dark-
ness of Alzheimer’s disease.
Approximately 50 million people,
worldwide, are living with Alzheimer’s
disease and other dementias. This not
only has a devastating impact on those
who are diagnosed with the disease, but
also their caregivers and their loved
ones.
More than 15 million Americans pro-
vide unpaid care to families and friends
living with Alzheimer’s and other de-
mentias. Compared with caregivers for
people without dementia, twice as
many caregivers for people with de-
mentia indicate substantial emotional,
financial, and physical stress.
Madam Speaker, the time to act is
now. Let’s join the fight. Let’s take the
pledge to raise awareness about Alz-
heimer’s disease and to never stop
searching for a cure.
f
ENERGY WEATHERIZATION
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
(Mr. TONKO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, our
neighbors and low-income households
pay three times more as a share of
their income on energy bills than those
in higher income strata.
The fiscal year 2020 Energy and
Water appropriations bill marks an im-
portant step to reduce that energy bur-
den for America’s most vulnerable peo-
ple by increasing investments in the
Department of Energy Weatherization
Assistance Program.
This program helps families make
their home healthier and safer. It pro-
motes energy efficiency and reduces
utility bills, which means more money
in the pockets of these families for
healthcare, groceries, and other basic
expenses.
For each dollar the American people
invest in the weatherization program,
we see an estimated $4.50 in energy and
nonenergy benefits. This additional
funding will ensure that even more
families are able to experience the ben-
efits of the program.
The Energy and Water bill also rec-
ognizes America’s need for clean en-
ergy innovation by significantly in-
creasing funding for essential DOE re-
search programs, including the Office
of Energy Efficiency and Renewable
Energy, the State Energy Program and
ARPA-E.
The work done by DOE and State en-
ergy offices is absolutely critical to ac-
celerate our Nation’s transition to a
clean energy economy. This bill recog-
nizes the need for the United States to
continue to be the global leader in
clean energy innovation, technology
development, and deployment.
I thank and express my gratitude to
Chairwomen LOWEY and KAPTUR for
their leadership on these issues.
HONORING THE LIFE OF
ATTORNEY JERRY BRADY
(Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life of Peoria Coun-
ty State’s Attorney Jerry Brady, who
was laid to rest this week. Jerry Brady
was an admired public servant in the
Peoria legal community and beloved by
everyone who had the pleasure of
knowing him.
Jerry grew up in Peoria, attending
Spalding Institute High School and
graduating from Bradley University
and Saint Louis University law school.
In 1981, he became an assistant
state’s attorney in Peoria County and
went on to run a successful law prac-
tice for nearly 30 years, where he
served until his unfortunate passing.
Inside the courtroom, Jerry was
known as one of the most principled
and hardest working legal minds in all
of central Illinois. Outside of the court-
room, he was known as a benefactor,
friend, and role model throughout the
community.
Jerry was instrumental in numerous
fundraising efforts to support the Peo-
ria community, including the recent
completion of our veterans memorial
in downtown Peoria.
Jerry was a selfless public servant
who left a profound impact on our com-
munity, and Peoria, Illinois, misses
him and will miss him in the future.
As our community mourns his loss,
my thoughts and prayers are with his
wonderful wife, Sue, and their three
children. He will be missed.
f
CELEBRATING PRIDE MONTH
(Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Madam Speaker,
as we celebrate Pride Month, we are re-
minded of the great strides towards
equality we have taken.
Madam Speaker, 50 years ago, on the
streets outside the Stonewall Inn
where the modern LGBTQ rights move-
ment began, the journey towards
equality, no doubt, looked endless.
Today, we can see the end in sight. And
yet, for all of our success, the struggle
continues.
We cannot rest; we cannot com-
promise; we simply cannot allow the
demagogues of ignorance, of fear, and
of hatred of others, no matter what
levels of power they hold, to stop our
march forward.
We must redouble our efforts to en-
sure that life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness applies to each and every
American, no matter who they are and
no matter whom they love.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5011
June 21, 2019
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I
rise today ahead of a public hearing set
to be held in my congressional district
by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
on the proposed delisting of the gray
wolf. The gray wolf has recovered.
In fact, back in 2013, the Obama ad-
ministration delisted the gray wolf for
precisely the same reason we are
today: because of science. Yet the gray
wolf remains listed, and without a
State-developed management plan in
place, the population in northeastern
Minnesota is growing at an uncontrol-
lable rate.
Within the Duluth city limits, which
is the largest city in Minnesota’s
Eighth District, a Labrador retriever
was recently attacked by wolves while
its owner was just a few feet away. At-
tacks on cattle owned by farmers try-
ing to make ends meet continue to be
all too common.
Madam Speaker, my State’s Depart-
ment of Natural Resources will effec-
tively manage the species once the
Federal Government moves itself out
of the way.
I am incredibly grateful to Interior
Secretary Bernhardt and the Fish and
Wildlife Service for choosing to hold
this forum in the heart of gray wolf
country. No one knows this issue bet-
ter than those living in northeast Min-
nesota.
f
IN RECOGNITION OF IMMIGRANT
HERITAGE MONTH
(Mr. VARGAS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. VARGAS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in recognition of Immigrant Her-
itage Month and the millions of immi-
grant families living, working, and
thriving within the United States.
For centuries, our country has wel-
comed those in search of a better life
and has benefited from their meaning-
ful contributions.
As a proud Mexican American, it is a
special honor to celebrate my family’s
immigrant heritage and our Nation’s
entire immigrant community. Like
countless others, my parents came to
the United States looking for hope and
opportunity for themselves and for the
generations to follow.
Thanks to their courage and sac-
rifice, my siblings and I were able to
pursue our American Dreams, an op-
portunity that is currently, unfortu-
nately, slipping away for far too many.
Today, we are witnessing the dev-
astating effect of President Trump’s
cruel anti-immigrant agenda, where
immigrants are demonized and treated
as outsiders; migrants are denied their
legal rights to asylum and safety; chil-
dren are ripped apart from their par-
ents; and adults and children are dying
while in U.S. custody.
This is not who we are.
Immigrants from far and wide help
build and better our Nation. They have
and will continue to be a source of
strength to inspire us.
I stand with immigrants today, and I
think we all should.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
WILD). Members are reminded to re-
frain from engaging in personalities to-
ward the President.

UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA
AGREEMENT
(Mr. HAGEDORN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. HAGEDORN. Madam Speaker,
today I rise to encourage the Speaker
of the House to give expeditious consid-
eration of the United States-Mexico-
Canada Agreement. There is progress
on this agreement being made. The
country of Mexico, their senate just
ratified it. Canada is looking to move
very quickly, and it is critically impor-
tant that we do the same.
Along those lines, 1,000 groups in this
country: manufacturing, agriculture,
transportation, and processing groups
have written us and said: We need to
get this deal done now.
In Minnesota, it is not just agri-
culture. It is machinery. It is manufac-
turing. It is medicine, and people like
my friends at the Farm Bureau,
AgriGrowth, poultry, dairy, pork; you
name it, everybody wants it done.
If we can get this Mexico-Canada
Free Trade Agreement with the United
States done, we are going to build mo-
mentum for our deals with China,
Japan, South Korea, Colombia, and the
European Union.
We should be dropping down the bar-
riers, expanding our trade, creating
economic growth, creating high-wage
jobs, and helping the American people
and our consumers.

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 962,
BORN-ALIVE ABORTION SUR-
VIVORS PROTECTION ACT
Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary be discharged
from further consideration of H.R. 962,
the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Pro-
tection Act, and ask for its immediate
consideration in the House.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been
cleared by the bipartisan floor and
committee leaderships.
Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker, if
this unanimous consent cannot be en-
tertained at this time, I encourage the
Speaker and the majority leader to
schedule immediate time for consider-
ation of the Born-Alive bill so that we
can stand up and protect the sanctity
of life.

tleman is not recognized for debate.

AMENDMENT NO. 195 OFFERED BY MR. RASKIN

in part B of House Report 116–119.
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Chairwoman, I

The text of the amendment is as fol-

Mr. RASKIN. Madam Chairwoman, I
rise today to offer an amendment to
H.R. 3055, relating to a problem taking
place in my district that may be reflec-
tive of what is happening in many
other parts of the country.
A fire station on a military installa-
tion recently experienced a devastating
fire itself, but now cannot get the
funds it needs to construct a new fire-
house.
Madam Chairwoman, the United
States spends billions of dollars every
year on military projects, but we need
the funds to fix and maintain the basic
buildings and infrastructure that have
fallen into disrepair on military instal-
lations across the country.
This situation was brought to my at-
tention by constituents who work at
the Naval District of Washington Fire
and Emergency Services station lo-
cated at the Naval Support Activity
Bethesda installation in Maryland.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5012 June 21, 2019
for 40 tenant commands, including Wal-
ter Reed National Military Medical
Center, which the Members of this
body know well.
Earlier this year, a fire broke out at
NSA Bethesda’s station, which exacer-
bated already hazardous conditions at
the firehouse. It began in the kitchen,
but because the fire alarm never went
off, the flames spread into other rooms,
causing extensive damage and ren-
dering the firehouse basically unfit for
occupancy. Fortunately, no one was in-
jured because no one was there, but
had the fire occurred overnight while
everyone was asleep, it would have
been a nightmare.
For several years prior to the fire,
concerns about the safety of the fire-
house, which was built in 1942, were
raised by the people who live and work
there. The complaints ranged from
dangerous mold and asbestos, to roof
leaks, electrical problems, and struc-
tural instability.
Temporary trailers erected next to
the firehouse are also at a breaking
point with air-conditioning units that
only work intermittently, chronic
mold, and leaking septic pipes. Yet, the
complaints of the firefighters, para-
medics, and EMTs were minimized or
ignored. The firefighters have been told
repeatedly that there is simply no
money available to renovate or to build
a new fire station.
In response to the hazardous condi-
tions caused by the fire, the Naval Fa-
cilities Engineering Command simply
put up some drywall and told the fire-
fighters that the building was now
ready to reoccupy.
The firefighters work 48-hour shifts
and sometimes longer. They are wor-
ried about the carcinogens they are
being exposed to, not just when they
enter burning buildings, but when they
breathe the air inside their own fire-
house. This is happening at the fire
station that responds to emergencies
on an installation that is home to Wal-
ter Reed National Military Medical
Center, the most prominent military
hospital in America.
The men and women working there
serve our military and our Nation’s
wounded warriors. Many of the fire-
fighters, EMTs, and paramedics are
themselves former soldiers, sailors,
marines, airmen, and coastguardsmen.
One of my constituents said: ‘‘I served
4 years in the Army and was deployed
overseas. The conditions in the fire-
house are, by far, the worst conditions
I have seen or lived in.’’ Another told
me that he lived in better conditions
when he was serving in Afghanistan.
This is shocking and unacceptable.
The men and women working at the
fire station deserve better. They need
funding to build a new, safe, clean, fire
station. In a Defense budget of hun-
dreds of billions of dollars, we should
be able to have money for essential
projects like this one.
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ), my colleague who has been a
real leader on this issue and is the
chairwoman of the Military Construc-
tion, Veterans Affairs, and Related
Agencies Subcommittee.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Madam Chairwoman, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding, and I rise in sup-
port of this excellent amendment.
The health and safety of our troops
in the surrounding communities is
paramount. We need to ensure basic
projects, like fire stations, are funded
properly, just as training ranges, bar-
racks, hospitals, and schools are. I look
forward to working with the gentleman
in future budget submissions, and I
urge my colleagues to support the
amendment.
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Chair, I look
forward to working with the gentle-
woman to secure funding for projects
like the one in my district.
I urge all of my colleagues to support
this amendment, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN).
The amendment was agreed to.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentlewoman
from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ) and the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. CARTER) each will control 10
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Florida.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Madam Chairwoman, the amendments
included in the en bloc were made in
order by the rule and have been agreed
to by the ranking member, Judge Car-
ter and I, and I support the amendment
and urge its adoption.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Chair-
woman, I rise in support of the en bloc
amendment. Let me thank the chair-
woman of my subcommittee, my good
friend from Florida, for her efforts to
put this bipartisan amendment to-
gether. It improves and strengthens
the bill, and I urge my colleagues to
support it.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Madam Chairwoman, I yield 1 minute
to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania
(Ms. HOULAHAN), a sponsor of one of the
amendments included in the en bloc.
Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
I rise today in support of my amend-
ment which would increase the Vet-
erans Health Administration Medical
Services account by $1.7 million in
order to increase the minimum amount
that must be spent on gender-specific
care for women at the VA with the ap-
propriate offset.
Women represent the fastest growing
cohort in our Nation’s military, and in
the past 4 years, the number of women
veterans using VHA services has in-
creased by 22 percent. Yet, we are not
providing the VA with the resources it
needs to provide quality care for
women.
For example, in my community of
Coatesville, the VA does not have a
full-time OB–GYN. Women veterans in
my community must wait until 1 of the
only 2 days a month that an OB–GYN
visits the VA or find their way to dis-
tant Philadelphia for an appointment.
This lack of available gender-specific
care is in no way unique to my commu-
nity. It is widespread across our coun-
try’s VA centers. Our women who have
served deserve better from us, and this
amendment helps ensure that we are
specifically addressing the unique
healthcare needs of these courageous
women.
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Chair-
woman, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. MCCAR-
THY), the minority leader of the United
States House.
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Chair-
woman, I thank the gentleman for
yielding.
I rise today in support of my amend-
ment to H.R. 3055, which is included in
the en bloc amendment.
The intent behind my amendment is
straightforward. It is to encourage the
VA to complete construction of med-
ical clinics that the Congress author-
ized 10 years ago in public law. Unfor-
tunately, veterans in my district have
now patiently waited for the new com-
munity-based outpatient clinic in Ba-
kersfield to be built for more than a
decade.
Of the 15 new clinics authorized in
2009, a decade ago, the Bakersfield clin-
ic is the only facility that has not been
built or opened. That means that thou-
sands of veterans in California’s 23rd
Congressional District must continue
to depend on a very outdated clinic.
This is unacceptable.
In 2015, our constituents and I were
informed that a new VA clinic was set
to be built, only for that to be derailed
by the now-failed California high-speed
rail project, condemning the property
the new clinic was supposed to be built
on.
b 0930
This forced the VA to start all over
again, further delaying building our
new clinic.
Now, last October there was this
great excitement in the community. I
welcomed it. It was the long-awaited
news that the VA announced that it fi-
nally awarded the contract for a new
30,000-square-foot medical clinic in Ba-
kersfield on Knudsen Drive. This new
clinic would be state of the art, and it
would be able to care for the rise in fe-
male veterans and the homeless vet-
erans out there as well. It was the mod-
ernization that we have all been yearn-
ing for.
Unfortunately, something happened.
The new clinic has been subject to sev-
eral, what I would call, dilatory ac-
tions. Most of them have been resolved
or dismissed, which only furthers the
delay.
Now, you can protest. Here is a dirty
little secret we should all learn: You
can have the lease on an outdated clin-
ic, bid for the new one and lose it, but
then you can protest.
Do you get punished for protesting?
No.
Do you know what happens? Our gov-
ernment rewards you. Because you go
beyond the lease, they now pay the
outdated clinic more money than they
paid before, and, lo and behold, they
are the ones protesting because they
didn’t win the contract.
That is unacceptable. Our veterans
have fought too hard to wait too long
to get this job done. So the VA must
move forward and be consistent with
the application of law and regulation.
Let’s build this clinic on Knudsen
Drive that won the award, and let’s
treat our veterans to a new, modern fa-
cility that works for those who really
are in need of care, from mental health
to a new growth in women veterans, to,
even, veterans who are homeless. Let’s
show that we will never forget the acts
that they did for us and how they
worked so hard for all of us.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.
GOTTHEIMER).
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Chair-
woman, I thank Chairwoman
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ and Ranking
Member CARTER for their work on this
legislation.
Madam Chair, I rise in support of en
bloc package 1, which includes my
amendment to H.R. 3055 to help address
critical staffing shortages at the VA.
Madam Chair, we in Congress have no
higher obligation than to care for our
veterans who had our backs, and that
starts with making sure they have the
resources they need when they come
home.
The number of unfilled positions at
the VA has grown steadily, and cur-
rently it is nearly at 49,000 across the
entire VA system.
Madam Chair, 49,000 vacancies is a
huge problem that we must tackle. One
constituent in my district, an 89-year-
old, has been waiting on the adjudica-
tion of his appeal to the VA for more
than a year. That is absurd. When we
called the VA to inquire, we were told:
‘‘This is just how long it takes.’’
Madam Chair, the Appropriations
Subcommittee on Military Construc-
tion, Veterans Affairs, and Related
Agencies looked closely at this issue
and stated that the committee is con-
cerned that the significant number of
vacancies will lead to longer waits for
veterans going without service.
I agree. We must address this prob-
lem and address it quickly. Our vet-
erans don’t have time for longer waits
for doctor appointments, mental health
crises, housing assistance, and so much
more.
Our veterans deserve better, and I am
proud to offer this amendment.
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Chair-
woman, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO).

women-only inpatient clinics for men-
tal healthcare.
The current system could force
women suffering with PTSD caused by
military sexual trauma to be admitted
into a male-dominant ward, which
could further traumatize or revictimize
them.
The veteran suicide rate is, sadly,
only increasing, and we need to protect
our veterans when they are feeling vul-
nerable. Women veterans should not be
humiliated, marginalized, traumatized,
or victimized to the point of giving up
and believing that suicide is the only
way out. We need to protect them.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Chair-
woman, I yield 45 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN).
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Chair, I rise to
thank the chairwoman and ranking
member for including the Allen-Hice
amendment in this en bloc package.
Congressman HICE and I worked to-
gether to introduce this bipartisan
amendment to fully fund the Presi-
dent’s budget request for construction
of the second project of the cyber in-
structional facility at Fort Gordon.
As we all know, cyber is the present
and future of modern warfare. In Geor-
gia 12, the district I have the honor of
representing, we are at the forefront of
advanced cyber innovation. In the
changing electronic world in which we
live, U.S. Army Cyber Command is an
increasingly significant part of our na-
tional security efforts.
U.S. Army Cyber Command is cur-
rently transitioning to Ford Gordon,
and this transition requires construc-
tion of state-of-the-art facilities that
can accommodate the rapid change of
pace required in cyberspace.
I thank Congressman HICE for joining
me in introducing this amendment, and
I urge the passage of this en bloc pack-
age.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Chair,
I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman
from Georgia (Mr. HICE).
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Chair, I
thank my colleague, Mr. ALLEN, for his
leadership in this.
The U.S. Army’s Cyber Center of Ex-
cellence is critical for cyberspace oper-
ations, signal and communications net-
works, and electronic warfare. The cen-
ter carries out its important mission
by developing mission doctrine, edu-
cational programs, personnel, and fa-
cilities solutions. It is of the utmost
importance that we make sure this tra-
dition of training world-class, highly
skilled cyber professionals is kept in-
tact.
Madam Chair, I urge passage of the
Allen-Hice amendment to fully fund
this project, and I urge all my col-
leagues to do the same.
I thank my neighbor and my friend
for yielding the time, and it is an
honor to work with Mr. ALLEN on this
important amendment.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.
GOTTHEIMER), who has been a pas-
sionate advocate standing up for mem-
bers of the Armed Forces as well as the
veterans of this country in his district.
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Chair, I
thank Chairwoman WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ and Ranking Member CARTER
for their work on this legislation and
leadership.
Madam Chair, I rise in support of
amendments en bloc No. 6, which in-
cludes my amendment to H.R. 3055 to
increase our investment in the Vet-
erans Health Administration for the
purpose of hiring more mental health
professionals.
Madam Chair, we in Congress have no
higher obligation than to care for our
veterans.
According to the inspector general
for the VA, mental health professionals
are the most needed occupation at the
VA. Many of those in the veterans
community are suffering from mental
health conditions with so many of
them, unfortunately, suffering in si-
lence. Less than half of all returning
veterans in need receive the mental
health treatment that they deserve and
need, and that is unacceptable.
We have seen an increased incidence
of post-traumatic stress disorder, trau-
matic brain injury, and depression
from our veterans coming back from
Iraq and Afghanistan. My office has
worked with a number of veterans who
are suffering from PTSD to make sure
they get access to the care they have
earned.
An average of 20 veterans die by sui-
cide every day. In New Jersey, my
home State, the rate of suicide in the
veterans community is almost double
that of the rest of the population. This
is shameful.
Madam Chairwoman, surely we can
all come together as a body to support
this most pressing and urgent need. My
amendment will help do that, and I am
proud to offer it.
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Chair-
woman, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON).
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam
Chair, I rise in support of my two
amendments that were made part of
the en bloc that we are debating.
My first amendment reflects congres-
sional intent for the Army to prioritize
necessary funding for its combat devel-
opment centers. These centers
throughout the United States play a
critical role in ensuring a capable and
ready ground force.
Take, for example, Fort Polk, which
is home to the Joint Readiness Train-
ing Center, JRTC, located in Louisi-
ana’s Fourth Congressional District
near my home. Fort Polk JRTC pro-
vides invaluable training to prepare for
the unique situations and challenges a
unit may face while being deployed.
As we continue to grow our ground
forces, investing in the necessary infra-
structure to replace the existing facili-
ties at Fort Polk, such as the Joint Op-
erations Center, we remember, is para-
mount. This much-needed upgrade
would allow our troops better training
and ensure full readiness for when our
men and women in uniform are called
upon to defend freedom around the
world.
My second amendment ensures con-
gressional intent that the Air Force
continues to maintain its revised plan
for construction and upgrades to the
Weapons Generation Facility enter-
prise. Ensuring these critical upgrades
to those facilities is critical to the na-
tional security interests of the U.S., es-
pecially given the recent aggressive ac-
tions from our adversary. Deterrence is
a requisite to maintaining peace, and if
Congress is going to be serious about
preserving our nuclear infrastructure,
these upgrades must be prioritized.
My home State of Louisiana has in-
vested millions of dollars to pave the
way for the Weapons Generation Facil-
ity at Barksdale Air Force Base, home
to Global Strike Command. I urge the
Air Force to continue to work with
Congress and the Louisiana delegation
to support the wide array of strategic
deterrence that we do there at Global
Strike.
Madam Chair, in closing, I am proud
to represent both these vital military
installations here in Congress. Both
are critical to our national security in-
terests in the United States, and I ap-
preciate the Appropriations Committee
for giving it due attention.
Madam Chair, I urge support of both
amendments.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Chair,
I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman
from Louisiana (Mr. ABRAHAM).
Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam Chair, I rise
today in support of the two amend-
ments included in this en bloc package.
The first is to ensure that the Air
Force prioritizes construction of the
Weapons Generation Facility at
Barksdale Air Force Base.
The Louisiana congressional delega-
tion and I have continued to push the
Air Force for this project because of its
strategic importance to our Nation’s
security and nuclear strategy. Millions
of Federal dollars have been invested
in projects to prepare for this facility,
and last year, we in Congress
prioritized funding for a new gate en-
trance at Barksdale.
The Weapons Generation Facility at
Barksdale is a national security imper-
ative. Funding this project cannot wait
any longer, and I encourage the Air
Force to prioritize funding for this
project.
The second amendment I would like
to speak on is to prioritize the funding
of our Army’s combat development
centers. One of these is the Joint Read-
iness Training Center at Fort Polk,
Louisiana.
Fort Polk has supported training op-
erations for our Army for decades. The

training our soldiers receive at Fort
Polk is the best and closest they will
get to combat without actually being
deployed. This training is imperative
to readiness and our national security.
We need to do a better job about
resourcing the infrastructure needs of
these training centers, and we must
prioritize funding for them.
Madam Chair, I want to thank my
colleagues for working with Congress-
man JOHNSON and me on these amend-
ments, and I look forward to seeing
them pass.
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Chair-
woman, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. STEIL).
Mr. STEIL. Madam Chair, I rise in
support of my amendment to ensure
that the VA suicide prevention pro-
grams are adequately funded. This
budget-neutral amendment provides $1
million to those programs.
Every day, we lose 22 veterans to sui-
cide. These are American heroes—fa-
thers, husbands, wives, sons, and
daughters—valued members of our
community. We must support our vet-
erans and fight for them as they fought
for us. They will not go through this
battle alone.
June is PTSD Awareness Month. We
must stand together, Democrats and
Republicans, to ensure that our vet-
erans get the help that they need.
This amendment is about supporting
veterans and ensuring that they have
access to mental healthcare resources.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support this amendment.
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Chair,
I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman
from Arkansas (Mr. HILL), who will be
batting cleanup.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Chair,
I thank my good friend from Texas for
yielding me this time.
Madam Chairwoman, my amendment
in this en bloc package is very simple.
It transfers $1.5 million from the gen-
eral administration account to the
homeless assistance programs and sui-
cide prevention outreach.
According to the Department of
Housing and Urban Development, 40,000
veterans are homeless in any given
night in this great country. In Arkan-
sas, we have coordinated robust efforts
in Little Rock to combat homelessness,
but still 250 veterans can experience
homelessness on any given day.
I have got three veterans on my con-
stituent team. They spend time in our
shelters every month helping vets. Our
vets deserve that extra touch. One of
those safe places is St. Francis House,
a nonprofit in Little Rock that has
done exceptional work to help our vet-
erans experiencing homelessness. For
over 30 years, they have been providing
transitional housing for homeless vet-
erans.
Our veterans put their lives on the
line to protect our freedoms and safety,
and in return, we need to do everything
we can to ensure they get the proper
attention and care that they deserve.
We must all work together to continue
to move forward, addressing this issue
that plagues too many of our veterans
across the country and help those suf-
fering from the plague of homelessness.
Madam Chair, I urge passage of my
amendment.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Chair-
woman, may I ask how much time is
remaining.

b 0945
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Chair,
I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman
from Illinois (Mr. BOST).
Mr. BOST. Madam Chair, I rise today
in support of this en bloc package.
My amendment highlights the posi-
tive work done by public universities
and law schools offering pro bono legal
services for our Nation’s veterans.
As the ranking member of the Dis-
ability Assistance and Memorial Af-
fairs Subcommittee, I understand that
putting together a proper application
for disability benefits can be difficult
at times.
In my district, Southern Illinois Uni-
versity Carbondale School of Law of-
fers assistance to veterans when ap-
pealing disability claims. The program
has helped thousands of these heroes
and increases the chances for the vet-
erans receiving positive responses in a
timely manner.
I thank the chair and ranking mem-
ber for including this in the en bloc
package, and I urge its support.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentleman has expired.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Madam Chair, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. LYNCH. Madam Chair, I rise in support
of the en bloc which includes my amendment
providing an additional $1 million to the med-
ical services account, to be directed towards
public-private partnerships to help address
veteran suicide prevention; PTSD and TBI
treatment; and substance use disorders.
Madam Chair, taking care of our veterans
means taking care of both their physical and
mental well-being. Tragically, we are losing
veterans at a rate of around 20 a day to sui-
cide, many of whom are also dealing with
PTSD, traumatic brain injuries, and/or sub-
stance use disorder.
While the VA is doing tremendous work to
reach out to our veterans, the need is still
great so we must use every tool available to
help them. Through this public-private partner-
ship program the VA will work with research
universities, teaching hospitals and other com-
munity entities to reach more of our veterans
so they can get the help and care they need.
I thank the committee for including my
amendment in the en bloc and would urge my
colleagues to support it and the underlying bill.

WASSERMAN SCHULTZ).

AMENDMENT NO. 198 OFFERED BY MR.
BLUMENAUER
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 198 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Chair, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division D (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. ll. None of the funds made available
by this Act may be used to implement, ad-
minister, or enforce the policy limitation in
section 3(b) of the Veterans Health Adminis-
tration directive 1315 (issued on December 8,
2017), or any limitation of the same sub-
stance.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Oregon.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Chair,
this has been a very important week in
the evolution of the Federal policy to
end the failed policy of prohibition on
cannabis.
Yesterday, the House overwhelm-
ingly approved my amendment that
would prohibit the Department of Jus-
tice from interfering with any State-
legal cannabis activities. We had also
approved an amendment that granted
the same protections to the Tribes.
This is remarkable progress that we
have seen, but it is just an effort by
Congress to catch up to where the rest
of the American public is.
For the last 23 years, American vot-
ers have changed the policies that are
outmoded and dangerous. Most re-
cently, we have seen a wave of activity
dealing not just with medical mari-
juana but dealing with adult use. The
public, by a two-thirds margin, sup-
ports this.
And, when we talk about medical
marijuana, it is like the Fourth of
July. Ninety percent of the American
public believes that we ought to have
access to medical marijuana.
I have been working in this Congress
to extend the same opportunities to
our veterans, who, if anything, need
medical marijuana more than any
other category of our citizens. We lost
7,000 people to the wars in Afghanistan
and Iraq, but we have lost over 100,000
veterans to suicides and opioid
overdoses.
The VA, I am afraid, has not been as
helpful as it should be. They prescribe
opioids for our veterans at a rate 50
percent higher than others. Our vet-
erans are twice as likely to die from
overdose.
I am deeply concerned about that.
That is why I have repeatedly advanced
this amendment. Two sessions ago, it
passed the House, it passed the Senate,
and it was in the final version of the
bill, only to be stripped out by the Re-
publican leadership.

stripped this provision out was headed
by Speaker Boehner, who is now a
spokesperson for the cannabis indus-
try, having described that he has
evolved on this issue and thinks it is a
good idea.
We haven’t evolved, in this Congress,
in providing protections for the VA.
Even though this amendment has
passed repeatedly, all of a sudden, the
VA has decided, well, they would be
putting their doctors at risk.
It never came up before. If we had
known about it, we could work around
it. And I think we can and should work
to fix this.
It is outrageous. And if you talk to
people like the Veterans Cannabis Coa-
lition, or talk to veterans in your own
district, they will tell you that their
lives have been transformed by access
to medical cannabis and they don’t
want highly addictive, dangerous
opioids.
We need to do right by them. I am
going to, reluctantly, withdraw this
amendment, this amendment that has
passed repeatedly on the floor of the
House and is so badly needed.
And I hope that we will be able to
work together to fix this little quirk,
to make sure that VA doctors can do
what doctors everywhere do in States
where medical cannabis is legal and be
able to work with their patients.
The VA ought to give their patients,
our veterans, the same consideration
to have them be able to have these con-
versations with the doctors that know
them best.
As I say, Madam Chair, I will reluc-
tantly withdraw it, confident that we
can work together to solve it and, ulti-
mately, give our veterans the access
that they deserve and need.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time, and I withdraw the
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The amendment
is withdrawn.
AMENDMENT NO. 199 OFFERED BY MR. WALBERG
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 199 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Chair, I rise
having an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division D (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. ll. None of the funds made available
by this Act may be used by the Secretary of
Veterans Affairs to implement, administer,
or enforce section 17.3240 of title 38, Code of
Federal Regulations, as proposed in 82 Fed.
Reg. 48018 (October 16, 2017) and amended in
83 Fed. Reg. 61137 (November 28, 2018).
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Michigan.
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Chair, I rise
today in support of an important issue:
preserving veterans’ choices over their
prosthetic services.
While I am prepared to withdraw this
amendment—we have had discussions
about that—I would hope that I can
continue to work with the chairwoman
as we move to conference on improving
the underlaying report language.
Last year, the VA released a draft
proposed rule which would have signifi-
cantly curtailed veterans’ choices in
how they receive their prosthetic or
orthotic care.
While we appreciate the Secretary’s
efforts to address the concerns of the
veterans, I remain concerned that the
proposal does not go far enough to pro-
tect veterans’ ability to select high-
quality, convenient, and efficient serv-
ices from community-based providers
of their choice.
This proposal would have upended
more than 60 years of successful part-
nership between the VA and local
prosthetists who contract with the VA
and have long-term relationships with
their patients. This long-term relation-
ship is critical for the unique, patient-
centered care needs of prosthetics serv-
ices.
I would also like to thank my col-
league, Representative RUTHERFORD,
for working on this issue with me.
Madam Chair, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ) to at least assure me that we
can continue to work on this issue to-
gether.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman
for yielding.
I appreciate the gentleman from
Michigan for bringing attention to this
important issue. We can all agree that
we want to let veterans choose the best
prosthetics provider for his or her
needs.
As you know, we included report lan-
guage expressing concern on this issue,
but I do agree that more needs to be
done. We want the best care for our
veterans, and we need to find a way
forward to determine the appropriate
next steps.
We should work with the authorizers
and the VA to thoughtfully work on
this issue to find the best solution for
veterans needing artificial limbs.
I commit to working with the gen-
tleman on this issue. We are not quite
ready to make a decision on the best
approach to this as we move towards
conference. I thank the gentleman for
his willingness to withdraw the amend-
ment.
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Chair, based
upon that and, also, an understanding
of the chairwoman’s willingness to at
least look at how we can find an ade-
quate solution to meet the needs of our
servicemembers who have given their
all for our great country, I am willing
to continue working on that.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time, and I am willing to
withdraw this amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The amendment
is withdrawn.
AMENDMENT NO. 206 OFFERED BY MR. BOST
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 206 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Mr. BOST. Madam Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division D (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. ll. None of the funds made available
by this Act may be used in contravention of
Executive Order 13858.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from Illinois (Mr. BOST) and a Member
opposed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Illinois.
Mr. BOST. Madam Chair, I rise today
in support of my amendment in sup-
port of the President’s executive order
entitled ‘‘Strengthening Buy-American
Preferences for Infrastructure
Projects.’’
When Federal agencies spend tax dol-
lars, those dollars should be spent on
American-made products. This not
only includes items directly procured
by the Federal Government but, also,
those funded through Federal aid pro-
grams.
Each year, the Federal Government
will spend hundreds of billions of dol-
lars procuring goods and services.
Many billions more will be provided di-
rectly to States to build our Nation’s
military infrastructure.
Unfortunately, buy-American pref-
erence requirements are not consist-
ently applied between various agencies.
This may result in the loss of jobs and
missing contract opportunities for
American businesses and workers.
To address these potential shortfalls,
the President’s executive order directs
agency heads to identify opportunities
to maximize the use of American-made
products.
I strongly support those efforts. Fed-
eral agencies should already be fol-
lowing this executive order, and my
amendment would simply reinforce the
President’s efforts.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Madam Chair, I claim the time to
speak on the amendment, although I do
not oppose the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentlewoman from Florida is

There was no objection.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Madam Chair, I do fully support
Strengthening Buy-American Pref-
erences for Infrastructure Projects.
That language is already included in
this legislation, and I appreciate the
gentleman underscoring the impor-
tance of our commitment to buy-Amer-
ican policies.
I urge all my colleagues to support
this amendment, and I yield back the
balance of my time.

SKI and his support of these efforts as
well.
Madam Chair, with that, I yield back

AMENDMENT NO. 219 OFFERED BY MR.
CUNNINGHAM
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 219 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Chair, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division D (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. ll. None of the funds made available
by this Act may be used to carry out a new
or additional Base Realignment and Closure
(BRAC) Round.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from South Carolina (Mr. CUNNINGHAM)
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from South Carolina.
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Chair, I
rise in support of my bipartisan amend-
ment which makes clear that no fund-
ing made available by this bill can be
used to carry out another wasteful
round of base realignment and closure,
or BRAC.
Folks in the Lowcountry still re-
member the disastrous effects BRAC
had on our economy in the past. Our
region lost more than 20,000 jobs, ac-
cording to some estimates, after the
1993 BRAC Commission recommended
the closure of the Charleston Naval
Shipyard.
My amendment would make sure
that the Joint Base Charleston, Parris
Island, Marine Corps Air Station Beau-
fort, and the Beaufort Naval Hospital
do not suffer the same fate.
b 1000
Combined, these important national
security assets are estimated to ac-
count for nearly $13 billion in economic
impact and support 78,000 jobs.
But this amendment isn’t just about
preserving my district’s economy. It is
also about fiscal responsibility. The
last BRAC round in 2005 cost taxpayers
over $35 billion and is not expected to
save even one-third of that.
This is funding that should have gone
to rebuilding our military and improv-
ing its readiness but was, instead,
spent devastating military commu-
nities across the country.
This is why I am asking that my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle join
me in supporting this amendment,
which will ensure that military com-
munities in the Lowcountry and across
the Nation are spared the effects of an-
other reckless BRAC round.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr.
Chair, I claim the time to speak on the
amendment, although I do not oppose
it.
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. SCHNEIDER).
Without objection, the gentlewoman
from Florida is recognized for 5 min-

There was no objection.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr.
Chair, I rise to point out that DOD has
testified that it has excess facilities
and needs a way to deal with that ex-
cess.
Mr. Chair, the underlying bill does
not include any funds to initiate a
BRAC round, and I have no objection
to the amendment. I appreciate the
gentleman calling attention to the eco-
nomic impact of BRAC rounds, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Chair, in
closing, I thank the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. RATCLIFFE) for joining me
in offering this amendment. I also
thank Chairman MCGOVERN and my
colleagues on the Rules Committee for
allowing this important amendment to
come to the floor for debate.
I ask that my colleagues vote in
favor of this amendment to ensure that
our military’s limited resources are
not wasted on another round of BRAC.

ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Maine.
Mr. GOLDEN. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume, and I
rise to offer my amendment to H.R.
3055. This amendment would increase
by about $5 million the medical facili-
ties account.
I did want to talk about a specific
problem. I think that most rural
States and communities understand
that when it comes to trying to take
care of our veterans, specifically, those
who are struggling with mental health
issues, and perhaps substance use dis-
order issues as well, it is an issue of
care closer to home and access to care.
When we have a veteran in a State
like Maine who is in need of acute
mental healthcare services and needs
long-term inpatient mental healthcare,
it has become known in the veterans
community in Maine that that care is
only available to veterans, at closest,
in Bedford, Massachusetts, or perhaps
as far away as New York or even fur-
ther in order to get access to those
beds. It is the same when they are in
need of long-term substance use treat-
ment programs.
I have seen time and time again,
working with veterans who are in need
of those services, that this is a signifi-
cant problem. It is a barrier to care. It
keeps people from coming in the door
at the VA to ask for help.
It is not just an issue in rural areas
among veterans. The problem is mir-
rored in the greater community.
This is not an instance where vet-
erans can go to the community to get
long-term inpatient care because, to
begin with, the beds aren’t there in
rural America. I think this is an in-
stance where we really need the VA to
step up to try to make sure that every
State has a baseline capability to pro-
vide long-term inpatient mental
healthcare services and substance use
disorder services to veterans as close to
their homes and their communities as
possible.
Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ), and I thank her for working
with me on this issue and for all the
work that she is doing on the com-
mittee.
I also thank the gentleman from
Idaho (Mr. FULCHER) for joining me on
this. I know Idaho is in the same boat
as Maine on this one.
Mr. Chair, I yield such time as she
may consume to the gentlewoman from
Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ).
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr.
Chair, we have recognized that there is
a lack of available overnight bed space
for mental health patients at VA facili-
ties, and this is a huge issue that the
VA is facing. In fact, we did provide an
additional $20 million within the med-
ical facilities account in the base bill
as an effort to begin to address this
dire need.
This amendment will add an addi-
tional, vital $5 million to expand VA
facilities and provide additional bed

space for veterans requiring overnight
mental healthcare. We can never do too
much to provide mental healthcare for
our veterans.
I urge my colleagues to support this
amendment. I congratulate the gen-
tleman on his leadership on this issue.
Mr. GOLDEN. Mr. Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment, although
I do not oppose it.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from Idaho is rec-
ognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Chair, this
amendment will invest $5 million into
those much-needed beds at long-term
care VA facilities. It is offset by a re-
duction for that same amount from the
VA IT systems account budget.
Most of Idaho’s veterans served in
Vietnam, and they are between 65 and
74 years old. While people are living
longer today, they also need more care.
And in this case, there are mental
healthcare concerns.
Passage of this amendment helps in
that regard, giving more bed space to
veterans in need of long-term
healthcare. These funds will also pro-
vide options to help Idaho’s heroes to
remain closer to their communities.
Many studies have found that people
tend to respond better to treatment
when they can be closer to their fami-
lies.
Please note that this does not add to
our growing deficit.
I thank my colleague from Maine,
Congressman JARED GOLDEN, for work-
ing with me on this bipartisan amend-
ment and for his service to our country
in the United States Marine Corps.
Improving care for our veterans
should always be an issue that we can
agree on. I urge my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle to join me in sup-
porting this amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. GOLDEN. Mr. Chair, I urge my
colleagues to support the amendment.
I again thank Congressman FULCHER
for joining me in this. It is critically
important.
I think he made a great point. With
care closer to home, it is about rela-
tionships, and it is about trust when
serving a population like veterans.
Also, when talking about things like
mental health and substance use treat-
ment care programs, that kind of fa-
miliarity and trust goes an awfully
long way.
I have talked to healthcare profes-
sionals who talk about continuity of
care as well. Even in this age, with the
internet, when trying to coordinate
continuity of care from New York to
Maine, when a veteran steps outside of
that inpatient care, it becomes very
difficult. This would all be solved, I
think, or at least be much more effi-
cient, if we had the ability to take care
of our veterans in our home States,
like Maine and Idaho.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.

tleman from Maine (Mr. GOLDEN).
The question was taken; and the Act-

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman

ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Utah.
Mr. MCADAMS. Mr. Chair, I rise
today to speak on my amendment en-
couraging the Department of Veterans
Affairs to improve veteran credit re-
porting and to implement important fi-
nancial protections for our veterans.
I thank the bipartisan cosponsors of
this amendment, Representative AXNE
from Iowa, Representatives GONZALEZ
and STIVERS from Ohio, Representative
BARR from Kentucky, and Representa-
tive ALLRED from Texas.
Congress created the Veterans Choice
Program to respond to inexcusable
wait time delays for veterans receiving
medical care at VA facilities. The
Choice program allowed veterans to ac-
cess non-VA medical facilities, pro-
viding for faster options in receiving
necessary medical care.
While veterans saw increased access
to healthcare, their financial health
took a hit as the VA and third-party
providers failed to process payments in
a timely fashion and actually made
billing errors, resulting in negative
credit reporting for our veterans even
though those payments were often not
the responsibility of the veteran.
My amendment encourages the VA to
make good on legislation that was en-
acted last year to ensure that these
credit reporting errors are fixed.
This legislation establishes a process
in which veterans can dispute nega-
tively reported credit scores due to VA
billing mishaps. It also requires credit
bureaus to remove information related
to a veteran’s fully paid or settled med-
ical debt that has been characterized as
delinquent, charged off, or in collec-
tion. This program will ensure our vet-
erans are not financially inhibited be-
cause of government error.
The VA was tasked with establishing
a database and process to verify wheth-
er a medical debt is related to the bill-
ing errors and filing mishaps within a
year of enactment. This 1-year grace
period allowed the VA to establish a
program to check medical debts, verify
debt accuracy, and provide a solution
for our veterans. However, the VA
missed that 1-year period at the end of
last month.
My amendment is simple. It simply
instructs the VA to submit to Congress
an implementation plan, including ex-
pected timeline and resource require-
ments for the VA to come into compli-
ance with the law and to establish
these important protections for our
veterans.
Good credit for our veterans is the
difference between qualifying for a
home loan or not. It is the difference
between investing in their education,
being able to buy a car, or qualifying
for a small business loan.
This important issue cannot wait.
Our Nation’s veterans should not be
punished because of government billing
errors. They deserve better, which is
why I encourage a ‘‘yes’’ on my bipar-
tisan amendment.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr.
Chair, as the designee of the gentle-
woman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY), I
move to strike the last word.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Florida is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr.
Chair, I rise to support this amend-
ment. I agree with my colleague from
Utah, and I appreciate him drawing at-
tention to this important issue.
Veterans’ credit scores should not be
negatively impacted by untimely or
improper payments by VA to third-
party providers. This is an unconscion-
able outcome to the irresponsible ac-
tions of the VA.
I understand VA is working with the
gentleman on this issue, and it is still
in the process of setting up a database
that will allow consumer reporting
agencies to verify whether or not a
debt furnished to a consumer reporting
agency is actually a veteran’s medical
debt, as required by Public Law 115–174,
the Economic Growth, Regulatory Re-
lief, and Consumer Protection Act. Un-
fortunately, due to the complexity of
setting up this database, it will take
longer than the 1-year deadline re-
quired by the law.
We must hold the VA accountable for
timely payments, and we cannot accept
veterans suffering the financial con-
sequences of VA’s improper or un-
timely payments.
I do commit to working with the gen-
tleman on this issue as we move
through the process. We need to make
sure that when our veterans come
home, they are able to seamlessly tran-
sition back to civilian life and not have
obstacles thrown in their path by the
VA’s own mistakes.

section 101(e)(8) of title 10, United States

The Chair recognizes the gentleman

Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Chair, I rise
in support of my amendment, which
would further emphasize our need to
ensure our military is prepared for the
ever-growing risk of climate change
and rising sea levels. To that end, my
amendment would make sure further
DOD construction projects meet mili-
tary resilience standards.
I have said time and time again that
climate change is our greatest non-
military threat, but climate change
also poses a significant threat to our
military’s readiness. Nowhere is this
clearer than in the Lowcountry, which
is home to some of our Nation’s most
critical national security assets. Parris
Island, one of only two military bases
that makes enlisted marines and the
only military base that makes female
enlisted marines, faces frequent flood-
ing and could be flooded for over a
third of the year by 2050.
Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort,
the only place in the world where pi-
lots are trained to fly the F–35B, faces
similar flooding risks, which threaten
to disrupt training and fielding of these
aircraft.
Just this year, Joint Base Charleston
was identified by the Air Force as one
of the top five bases most susceptible
to the risks associated with climate
change.
I am offering this amendment be-
cause it is imperative that these im-
portant defense assets are prepared,
not only because they are critical to
our national security, but also because
they are an indispensable part of our
economy in the Lowcountry.
Combined, these important national
security assets are estimated to ac-
count for nearly $13 billion in economic
impact and support 78,000 jobs in our
district.
Mr. Chair, this is an urgent issue
that threatens military installations
across this Nation, so I ask that my
colleagues join me in support of my
amendment and the readiness of our
Armed Forces.
Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ).
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr.
Chair, I thank the gentleman for yield-
ing.
The past year has been particularly
devastating to military installations in
multiple States, including my own.
There are bases that experienced hurri-
canes, tornadoes, and massive coastal
and river flooding.
Over time, gradual sea level changes
magnify the impacts of storm surge
and may eventually result in perma-
nent inundation of facilities and instal-
lations.
In my home State of Florida, Tyndall
Air Force Base was devastated by Hur-
ricane Michael.
Building resilient DOD facilities that
can sustain the impacts of damaging
storms and flooding is no longer an op-
tion but an essential requirement.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support the amendment. I commend
the gentleman for his leadership on
this issue.
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Chair, in
closing, I thank the gentlewoman from
Florida for speaking in favor of my
amendment and for all of her hard
work in constructing this year’s Mili-
tary Construction and Veterans Affairs
appropriations bill.
This legislation makes significant in-
vestments toward ensuring our men
and women in uniform have the facili-
ties they need to keep our Nation safe
and improving services at the VA. I
hope my colleagues on both sides of the
aisle join me in supporting my amend-
ment as well as the underlying bills.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr.
CUNNINGHAM).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 228 OFFERED BY MR. KIM
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 228 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Mr. KIM. Mr. Chair, I have an amend-
ment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 371, line 21, after the dollar amount
insert ‘‘(reduced by $7,000,000) (increased by
$7,000,000)’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from New Jersey (Mr. KIM) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New Jersey.
Mr. KIM. Mr. Chair, I yield myself
such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, as the vice chairman of
the Readiness Subcommittee of the
House Armed Services Committee, im-
proving road safety at and around our
military facilities is an important part
of maintaining and enhancing military
readiness.
Simply put, if our servicemen and
-women can’t safely drive, they can’t
safely train, and that puts our military
at a distinct disadvantage.
We have dozens of military facilities
across our country, but I want to give
you one example of how prioritizing
road safety will improve our readiness.
My district, made up of Burlington
and Ocean Counties in New Jersey, is
home to Joint Base McGuire-Dix-
Lakehurst. The joint base is a key
military training facility, but the lack
of proper investment in road safety
projects has impeded our military’s
ability to train.
By building a simple overpass over
Route 539, the Army Reserve would
have access to more than hundreds of
additional training acres. Because one-
third of Army reservists live within a
short drive of under 4 hours from the
joint base, additional training would
save us money and give them more
time with their families.
Furthermore, this would allow the
Army Reserve to conduct much-needed
training exercises with night vision
equipment used in war zones, training
exercises that they simply cannot exe-
cute because the roads aren’t safe
enough.
This is one example, but it is not the
only one.
This is a chance for us to stand with
our servicemen and -women, a chance
for us to stand for readiness, and a
chance for us to stand for safety.
Mr. Chair, I urge support for the men
and women across our country who
serve and the adoption of this common-
sense amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ).
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr.
Chair, I thank the gentleman for yield-
ing.
The maintenance of our roads in and
around our military installations is a
must for the safety of our servicemem-
bers and their families. It is also key
for the training and readiness of our
troops.

H5020 June 21, 2019
I look forward to working with the
gentleman in future budget submis-
sions to make sure that we can address
this important issue and protect the
safety of our troops.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support the amendment.
Mr. KIM. Mr. Chair, I thank the gen-
tlewoman from Florida for her words of
support here.
This is something that I find all of us
are committed to, in terms of ensuring
that our armed services men and
women have everything that they need
to be able to do their jobs and be able
to have the success of their missions.
Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman
from Florida for her support, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. KIM).
The amendment was agreed to.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE ACTING CHAIR
The Acting CHAIR (during the vote).
There is 1 minute remaining.
b 1104
So the amendment was agreed to.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
Stated for:
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Chair, on roll call no.
398, I mistakenly voted ‘‘no’’ when I intended
to vote ‘‘yes’’.
PERSONAL EXPLANATION
Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Mr. Chair, I was ab-
sent today due to a family medical emergency.
Had I been present, I would have voted: yea
on rollcall No. 396; yea on rollcall No. 397;
and yea on rollcall No. 398.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chair, I rise as the
designee of Chairwoman LOWEY of the
Appropriations Committee, and I move
that the Committee do now rise.
The motion was agreed to.
Accordingly, the Committee rose;
and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.
SHALALA) having assumed the chair,
Mr. SCHNEIDER, Acting Chair of the
Committee of the Whole House on the
state of the Union, reported that that
Committee, having had under consider-
ation the bill (H.R. 3055) making appro-
priations for the Departments of Com-
merce and Justice, Science, and Re-
lated Agencies for the fiscal year end-
ing September 30, 2020, and for other
purposes, had come to no resolution
thereon.
f
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I rise for
the purpose of inquiring of the major-
ity leader the schedule for next week.
I yield to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), our distinguished
majority leader.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, on Mon-
day, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for
morning-hour debate, and 2 p.m. for
legislative business, with votes post-
poned until 6:30 p.m.
Members are advised that debate on
amendments to H.R. 3055, the appro-
priations bill, could begin as early as 3
p.m. on Monday.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the
House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning-
hour debate, and 12 p.m. for legislative
business. Again, we will meet at 10 a.m.
Tuesday and Wednesday.
On Thursday, the House will meet at
9 a.m. for legislative business.
We will consider several bills under
suspension of the rules. The complete
list of suspension bills will be an-
nounced by close of business today.
The House will complete consider-
ation of the appropriations bill, H.R.
3055, which entails Commerce, Justice,
Science, Agriculture, Rural Develop-
ment, Food and Drug Administration,
Interior, Environment, Military Con-
struction, Veterans Affairs, Transpor-
tation, and Housing and Urban Devel-
opment Appropriations Act of 2020.
The House will also consider H.R.
3551, the Financial Services and Gen-
eral Government Appropriations Act of
2020. That will be the tenth appropria-
tions bill that we will consider and is
another step toward the House doing
its work to avoid a shutdown at the
end of the fiscal year.
The House will also consider H.R.
2722, Securing America’s Federal Elec-
tions Act. This legislation will protect
elections for public office by providing
financial support and enhanced secu-
rity for the infrastructure used to
carry out such elections.
b 1115
Lastly, additional legislative items
may also be considered, including leg-
islation related to humanitarian assist-
ance at the border and the legislative
appropriation bill.
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I
know the gentleman and I have been
having the conversation for well over a
month now about this crisis at the bor-
der. I am glad to hear that there is the
possibility, maybe the likelihood, that
there will be legislation coming to the
floor to address the crisis.
I am also aware, as the gentleman is,
that the Senate did just pass legisla-
tion out of committee to address the
crisis. It was a 30–1 vote, a very bipar-
tisan vote, to address the crisis.
In fact, I know that the Senate, both
Republicans and Democrats in the Sen-
ate, worked closely with the White
House to get to a point where, while
they don’t completely agree on all the
details, it seems clear that the White
House would be able to have this bill
signed by the President, which, again,
addresses the crisis before it becomes
imminent shutdown.
There was a letter sent just days ago,
and Secretary Azar has been making it
very clear how serious of a crisis this
is, literally to the point where they are
about to run out of money to take care
of young children who are coming over
illegally, many of whom have serious
health problems.
They want to take care of these kids.
They are properly taking care of these
kids, but they are about to run out of
money to take care of these kids.
They just sent an Antideficiency Act
notice, which means they basically are
out of money that has been appro-
priated by Congress. It would be a vio-
lation of the law to spend any money
after they have run out of money ap-
propriated by Congress. Under this act,
they can spend money in violation of
that law if it is to preserve life and
safety. They are at that critical of a
point.
I make all of these points just to ask
the gentleman: As we look at the Sen-
ate bill, while it might not be ideal, it
can be signed by the President. We
haven’t seen any details of what my
friend is working on right now. I am
not sure how closely the gentleman has
been working with the White House.
Has the gentleman been working with
the White House to come up with a bill
that can actually be signed by the
President in time to avert this crisis
before they run out of money in a mat-
ter of days?
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman.
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
First, let me say that I am pleased
that the gentleman refers to the
Antideficiency Act and that, in this in-
stance, the administration will not
spend money on an object that was not
designated for by the Congress of the
United States. This is for helping chil-
dren.
Obviously, when it wanted to build a
wall, it did exactly that. It tried to
shift money that was not appropriated
for. I am glad that, in this instance, we
are honoring it, number one.
Number two, let me say that I think
the Senate’s action was helpful. It was,
as the gentleman pointed out, bipar-
tisan. I think that will probably be
helpful to us here as well.
I want to say to the gentleman that
I know for a fact that, certainly within
the Appropriations Committee, there
have been bipartisan discussions all
along. There was a time when they
were very close to agreement on what
the bill would comprise.
It is my hope that as a result of both
these actions, as I said, my expectation
is that we will pass something next
week. That is my hope, and I know
that work is being done on it as we
speak. I know it will be done over the
weekend, and I am hopeful that we will
get there because this humanitarian
relief for the children and for adults,
for giving the proper treatment to peo-
ple who are in our country and in our
care, is very important, and we are
working very hard to get that done. My
hope is that it will be done.
Mr. SCALISE. I just can’t urge
enough that as these conversations are
happening and as this work is going on
over the weekend that it is work not
just among Democrat appropriators
and Democrat leadership but that the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5023
June 21, 2019
majority is working with Republicans
as well and with the White House as
well because we have been hearing that
there may be some of what would be
considered poison pills that might be
added.
There are things that the agency is
doing. For example, HHS is trying to
find more places to house these chil-
dren. They have over 13,000 children in
their custody right now, in their care,
and they want to take care of them.
They need the money to take care of
them. They are literally days away
from running out of money to take
care of them.
This is the midnight hour, but it is
not the midnight hour because they
just dropped it. This has been known
for over a month. They have been ask-
ing for this money for over a month.
They are days away from running out.
If this becomes a game where only a
partisan bill is brought to the floor
with poison pills that everybody knows
the White House can’t support, when
we have seen the Senate take action
with a 30–1 vote on a bill that the
President can support, if a bill comes
out of the House that does have those
kinds of poison pills and limits the
ability of the agency—not on the wall.
We are not even talking about all the
other problems with the border and
things that are causing so many people
to come over illegally. We still have to
deal with that. Now we are just talking
about taking care of these kids.
The Senate proved that they can pass
a bill in a very bipartisan way that can
be signed by the President. We need to
be working not just among Democrats
but among Republicans with the White
House on a bill the President can sign
because if we don’t pass a bill by the
end of next week—the gentleman from
Maryland makes the schedule. He
knows the schedule. We are not here on
July Fourth recess. Once we leave next
week, if we don’t have a bill that the
President can sign passed through the
House and through the Senate, they go
into shutdown mode. They will lit-
erally be in shutdown mode after the
July Fourth recess.
The employees of HHS will not get
paid. They will have to be finding
money to feed these young kids, over
13,000 of them, with moneys that are
not appropriated by Congress. They
will be out of money.
I appreciate that the gentleman has a
group working on a bill, but I can’t
urge enough that this bill has to be bi-
partisan and in a way that the Presi-
dent can sign by the time we leave next
week. If we go to conference because
the House passes a partisan bill when
the Senate proved that they can come
together and pass a very bipartisan bill
30–1 out of committee that the Presi-
dent will sign—we have to be working
on that same track.
Otherwise, if we leave next week
without a bill that is signed by the
President, they go into shutdown.
Those 13,000-plus kids who are being
treated will be being treated by HHS
employees who won’t be getting paid
and with money to feed them and take
care of their healthcare needs from
who knows what account.
There is no money left. Again, this
isn’t a new problem. This has been
known for over a month. We have been
urging action.
I would just urge that while the work
is being done over the weekend, can we
get an assurance that it will be done in
a way that we will be working with the
White House like the Senate did, Re-
publicans and Democrats, a 30–1 vote
out of committee, that kind of ap-
proach as opposed to an approach that
might include some poison pills that
everybody knows then poison the well
where it won’t be signed by the Presi-
dent?
I yield to the gentleman, Madam
Speaker.
Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman
for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I understand that
this is a critical issue that we need to
address, but I believe that the gen-
tleman is not accurate.
HHS employees are going to get paid.
This money that is being appropriated
is for the special, additional services
that we need to make sure are avail-
able. I don’t think there is a question
of HHS employees not getting paid.
More importantly, it is an issue as to
whether or not the services are going
to be available to provide the humani-
tarian treatment that the gentleman
talks about, and I think we are in full
agreement.
I will say again that I think the Sen-
ate’s action is helpful. It was bipar-
tisan. Very frankly, I think it, hope-
fully, is going to help us get to some
bipartisan agreement here.
Frankly, I will tell the gentleman,
we thought we were pretty close to a
bipartisan agreement with the Repub-
licans, and the Republicans and Demo-
crats have been working on this in the
committee, as the gentleman knows.
We were pretty close to agreement. We
didn’t get there.
They got to it in the Senate, which
meant the Democrats went along with
what the majority could support be-
cause they are the majority. Hopefully,
we can do that here and get a bipar-
tisan bill.
I will tell the gentleman that I am
working very hard and am very focused
on getting a bill done so that we do not
leave here without a bill having been
passed to provide this humanitarian re-
lief that is so essential.
Mr. SCALISE. I thank the gentleman
for that commitment because I know
that our teams will be talking. The
leadership teams will be talking and
working, hopefully, completely to-
gether in a way where, when we look at
the Senate bill, there are components
of the Senate bill that I would prefer
not be in there, and I know there are
things that the White House would
rather not have in that bill, but there
is give-and-take.
There has been give-and-take, and it
has gotten to a point where they at
least recognize that, with the things
that they might not want, there are no
poison pills in it. At least it gives them
the tools they need so that the agency
can take care of those 13,700-plus kids
who are here.
We can talk all day about why a
mother and father would send their 12-
year-old daughter on a journey from
another country into America, but it is
happening. When they come here, they
need to be properly taken care of, and
that money is literally about to run
out in days.
Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman
yield?
Mr. SCALISE. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland.
Mr. HOYER. I want to make a com-
ment on what the gentleman just said.
I think most of us are parents. I have
had three 12-year-old daughters. All
were 12 years of age at one point in
time, and I wouldn’t send them unless
I thought their lives were at risk, un-
less I thought they were in great dan-
ger by remaining with me, unless I
thought the alternative of staying was
worse than the risk.
That is why they come here, because
they are terrified that their child is
going to be taken from them by death,
not by trying to get to an America that
is the light of the world, that they
think is the land of opportunity. That
is why they come here. That is why
they take this risk.
Very frankly, we should have passed
comprehensive immigration reform a
long time ago so that there was a safe
route and an open door and so that peo-
ple seeking refuge and asylum, which is
under American law, would be able to
do that.
I agree. Sending these children has to
be wrenching for a parent. But the al-
ternative they find to be even more
wrenching, more dangerous, and riskier
for that 12-year-old child, and so they
send them here. They send them here
because the reputation of America is
that we will treat people humanely,
thoughtfully, and safely. And it is our
responsibility to do that.
Mr. SCALISE. I appreciate that, and
obviously, when you see that somebody
would send their child—let’s use Guate-
mala as an example because they are
one of the countries where a lot of
these young children are coming from.
They went through Mexico. Mexico of-
fered them asylum, and they turned
that down and, ultimately, came to
America.
I appreciate the fact that people look
to America as that beacon of freedom.
We are the beacon of freedom for a lot
of reasons.
One of the reasons is because we are
a nation of freedom and laws. We are a
nation of laws, and we need to find a
way to get back to the rule of law so
that we can have an immigration sys-
tem that works for everybody, not just
for the people who come over one way
but for the people who follow the rule
of law to come here legally.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5024 June 21, 2019
Millions of people are waiting today
to come to this great country and ulti-
mately will become part of the Amer-
ican Dream. They will add to the rich-
ness and greatness of our Nation.
But as those 12-year-old children are
coming over, they are right now in the
custody of HHS because of our laws.
But under our law, they are literally
running out of money.
The HHS Secretary sent a letter to
all of us over a week ago. In that let-
ter, he said that our valued Federal
employees in ORR who care for chil-
dren and place them with sponsors
would be required to work without pay.
That is from the Secretary of HHS.
Under the law, his employees would be
required to work without pay if we
break by the end of next week without
an agreement that is signed by the
President to properly fund the agency
that is taking care of these 13,700-plus
kids. That was from the letter Sec-
retary Azar and Secretary McAleenan,
the Acting Secretary of the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, sent to
every Member of Congress over a week
ago.
The agency has told us what the cri-
sis is. They have told us they are about
to run out of money. They have sent
the Antideficiency Act notice to make
it clear that under the law, if they run
out of money, the only money they can
spend is for life and safety of those
kids, and they are going to be doing
that.
But we can prevent that from hap-
pening. We need to prevent that from
happening.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman.
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I want
to correct myself. The gentleman was
correct. I have just been informed be-
cause they are funded, the employees,
specifically under that account, the
gentleman is correct and I was incor-
rect, and apparently, they would not be
paid.
Obviously, the general Labor-Health
bill that we passed up until September
30 of this year funds almost all employ-
ees. But apparently, because these
funds are segregated in this account,
my friend is correct that they would
not be paid.
In any event, while I am concerned,
and maybe some of those folks live in
my district, while I am concerned
about them being paid, I, frankly,
share my friend’s concern, which is a
much greater concern, that people who
come here under and consistent with
U.S. law, seeking asylum from the dan-
ger that they face at home, need to be
treated in a humanitarian way. So I
certainly agree that we want to make
sure people get paid.
We shut down the government for 35
days, and 400,000 people did not get
paid. Actually, 800,000 did not get paid,
and 400,000 people had to work.
b 1130
We offered numerous bills which,
very frankly, the gentleman’s party
voted against on a regular basis, which
would have opened up the government
and paid those employees. So, I wish
we had been more concerned, during
those 35 days, with them getting paid.
But the real concern—and I know the
gentleman and I share this view—is the
humanitarian treatment of the people
who are here in our care.
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, the
gentleman and I need to and, hopefully,
will work closely together—not iso-
lated, but together—over the weekend
to come up with a bill to solve this
problem, recognizing that the Senate is
going to, hopefully, move their own bill
that, while flawed, does address the
basic needs, so that those children can
be taken care of and the employees can
be paid, and we can come together and
get a bill done by the end of next week.
The urgency of getting it done by the
end of next week can’t be understated
because, after that, they have made it
very clear they do run out of money. It
is not a new issue. It is not something
that is thrown at us at the midnight
hour. For more than a month this has
been identified.
So, I appreciate that we are going to
work to get it done. Let’s make sure
we do work to get it done.
I know there are a lot of other issues
we can talk about: the appropriations
process, the need to come together on
an agreement on what the proper levels
of spending are and should be, that the
President would also agree with us on,
so that we can be writing appropria-
tions bills that would actually have the
chance to get signed into law and pre-
vent a shutdown, that kind of impasse,
by the end of September.
This is the emergency, immediate
need. There are other things that we
need to keep working on, and I look
forward to working with the gentleman
in the coming days and weeks to ad-
dress those problems as well.
If the gentleman has anything else, I
yield to the gentleman.
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I would
just say, as the gentleman knows be-
cause I have talked to him about it, I
have been trying to get an agreement
on caps since January.
I talked to Senator MCCONNELL; I
talked to Senator SHELBY; I talked to
Ranking Member GRANGER; obviously,
Mrs. LOWEY, the chairwoman of the Ap-
propriations Committee.
I have worked almost ceaselessly on
trying to get a caps deal, which I think
all of us think is absolutely essential.
Very frankly, I think there are those
down at the White House—and I spe-
cifically reference the Acting Chief of
Staff, Mr. Mulvaney—who believed
that a caps deal was not the policy
they thought ought to be proceeded on
and would have preferred and talked
about having either a sequester, which
I think neither side thinks would make
much sense, either on the defense side
or the nondefense side—but that a CR
was a preferred alternative and, frank-
ly, a negotiation at the very latest mo-
ment was a strategy.
I witnessed that, as the gentleman
knows, the Republican Senators tried
to negotiate with the White House so
that the Republican White House and
the Republican Senators tried to nego-
tiate a caps deal and could not. So, it
had nothing to do with Democratic
participation at that point in time.
Now, what we have done, as the gen-
tleman knows, is we have, in effect,
adopted a level of spending to which we
have marked our bills. That level of
spending, I will tell you, on the defense
side, I have reason to believe is agree-
able to many Republican leaders at the
top level on the gentleman’s side.
The domestic level of spending was
consistent with the raise in defense and
domestic, as we have done in prior
deals.
The prior, most recent deal, as the
gentleman knows, was reached between
Speaker Ryan and Senator MURRAY. I
would be hopeful that we would reach
such a deal.
Obviously, if the gentleman reaches a
deal, the President has to be part of
that, because you have got to amend
the sequester law by statute, and the
President has to sign it.
But we are moving ahead. This is our
alternative. We are going to be passing
10, 11 of our bills, we hope, next week,
and we will send them over to the Sen-
ate.
The Senate will, presumably, at some
point in time, act upon its bills. If
there is a different number, we will
have to reconcile the numbers, in con-
ference, in the regular order, and hope-
fully pass those bills in time so that
there will not either be the necessity
for a continuing resolution, which real-
ly is a recognition of the failure to get
the appropriations process done, which
has happened often on both sides of the
aisle, so it is not a question of just—
but, that the Congress has not reached
agreement, as it should have.
So, we are proceeding. We are pro-
ceeding in a timely fashion. We are
going to send at least 10 or 11 bills to
the Senate, and we will send the Home-
land Security bill, hopefully, at some
point in time, or reach agreement be-
tween the two parties, and the two
houses, so that I think we have done
everything we could possibly do, absent
the ability of, frankly, the gentleman’s
side to get agreement among itself on
what the gentleman thinks the cap
numbers ought to be.
I was hoping, in discussion with Sen-
ator MCCONNELL, that between the two
parties we could reach agreement, but
that has not happened. But, hopefully,
at some point in time it will happen
soon because, ultimately, it has to hap-
pen, because the sequester is not an op-
tion, and the CR ought not to be an op-
tion either.
We are doing our work, considering
amendments. We are in the regular
order. This is the way it should be
done. I am proud that it is being done
this way, and I am hopeful that it will
result in agreement and a signature on
appropriation bills by the President, so

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5025
June 21, 2019
we do not shut down the government or
have to operate under a CR.
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, the
political differences between the par-
ties are not mutually exclusive to Re-
publicans. Clearly, we have had ours
within the Budget Committee.
Now that you are in the majority,
the Democrats on the Budget Com-
mittee could not come to an agreement
amongst themselves about how to get a
budget, which is why the Democrat
majority, the gentleman’s Democrat
majority, didn’t pass a budget. The
first time in 9 years that the Budget
Committee hasn’t produced a budget
out of committee.
We produced all 8 years we were in
the majority. We had differences, clear-
ly, and some of those were well written
about in the press, but we ultimately
came together and passed our budgets,
every year of the 8 years, out of com-
mittee.
Many of those not only got through
the floor but went into law. Sometimes
we got those 2-year budget agreements
so we didn’t need the second year.
This is the time to be working on ne-
gotiating our differences. I am glad we
are having these conversations on find-
ing out if we can get to a caps deal.
Even the Acting Chief of Staff, Mr.
Mulvaney, who was mentioned, would
like to get a 2-year deal. I am sure he
has some things he would like in a deal
that the gentleman wouldn’t agree to,
but that is going to be negotiated.
That is why we have negotiations in
June, not in September when it is the
midnight hour.
So, I am glad we are having these
talks now. Of course we have dif-
ferences within our parties, the gentle-
man’s party and mine. Ultimately,
amongst ourselves, we will have dif-
ferences, but the ideal objective is that
we come together well before the Sep-
tember 30 deadline.
That is why it is important that
these discussions are being held now,
not in September, so that we can hope-
fully get that agreement and then
write appropriations bills.
I think the gentleman knows, the
bills that he is moving through the
process this week, next week, are not
bills that will be signed into law, not
only because, in many cases, the spend-
ing levels are well above what we
would agree to but, also, the many poi-
son pill amendments that will ulti-
mately get worked out in a conference
committee. They won’t be in a final
product.
But let’s at least try to get in agree-
ment on a caps deal. We are in a time
frame where, at least, it is responsible
to have these differences earlier, not
later, in the fiscal year.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman.
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, it is in-
teresting the gentleman says these
bills aren’t going to become law.
That had no restraint on the gentle-
man’s side of the aisle when that side
was in charge in the appropriations
bills the gentleman passed in a totally
partisan fashion, I would observe.
We didn’t think they would get past
the Senate. They didn’t get past the
Senate. They didn’t become law. There
was a compromise made.
The gentleman did the same thing.
Why? Because the gentleman thought
that was, from a policy standpoint, the
correct thing to do.
We are doing exactly the same thing.
Will we have negotiations between the
House and the Senate as to levels of
spending and other, as the gentleman
points out, provisions in the bills? Of
course we will.
But the assertion that: Why are you
passing bills? They won’t pass the Sen-
ate. I would hope they pass the Senate.
I think they are excellent bills. I think
they provide for the national security,
both on the defense side and on the do-
mestic side.
Very frankly, we put defense and
labor-health together. Why? Because
the gentleman had made that a way to
proceed.
Why did the gentleman make it a
way to proceed? Because those on the
other side, for the most part, are hesi-
tant to vote for the levels that we ex-
pect are necessary for education and
the health of our people.
Having said that, when the gen-
tleman says it won’t pass the Senate,
the gentleman’s bills didn’t pass the
Senate. The gentleman passed them be-
cause he thought they were good pol-
icy. We are passing them because we
think they are good policy.
And I, frankly, think, but for the fact
that I think the gentleman has ex-
pressed a policy on his side of, ‘‘Don’t
vote for these bills,’’ we would have
gotten a significant number of Repub-
lican votes on a number of these bills.
We did get some votes.
But let us hope that we get to a deal
on what the spending levels ought to
be. And, as I point out, without any
Democratic participation, the Repub-
lican Senators can’t get a level with
the White House. They tried. They
worked at it. It was publicly reported.
The gentleman has been unable to
get an agreement within his own party
on those levels. My view is, I think Mr.
Mulvaney doesn’t want a deal. Mr. SCA-
LISE says he wants a 2-year deal. I hope
he is right. I hope the gentleman is
right that Mr. Mulvaney will, with Mr.
Mnuchin, come to grips with doing a 2-
year deal to give us some degree of sta-
bility.
The gentleman is correct. He didn’t
have to get a budget because we made
a 2-year deal. It couldn’t have gotten
through the Senate if we hadn’t agreed
on it. But we made a 2-year deal. It
wasn’t exactly at the levels we wanted.
Senator MURRAY led that negotiation
on our behalf. We reached it, and we
had some degree of stability. And that
is why the other side was able to pass
their bills without a budget, because
we already had a number. They didn’t
need a 302a number.
Now we are getting into jargon here,
but suffice it to say, yes, we are pass-
ing bills at levels we think are appro-
priate. Many on the gentleman’s side
disagree with that. The Senate may
disagree.
The way we get to a resolution is we
have a conference and we come to an
agreement. Hopefully, that will hap-
pen, and we will not shut down the gov-
ernment of the United States, which
we did, partially, for 35 days. That is
the way this institution ought to work,
and I hope it does work that way.
Mr. SCALISE. I do appreciate this is
part of the process. And, again, I say
the reason that it is good that we are
having these talks now is because, as
we have our differences—the gentleman
within his own party, the gentleman
with us, us with the Senate, maybe
with the White House—we have time to
work that out now, and we don’t wait
until mid-September, late September,
to try to get that kind of agreement.
So, we will continue to have these
discussions. I am glad we are having
these discussions at this early point so
that it is not midnight-hour discus-
sions like we were talking about on the
supplemental.
Final point: I wanted to just com-
mend the gentleman. We had a very
good meeting yesterday, our two lead-
ership teams, with the Canadian Prime
Minister.
Mr. Trudeau was here to talk to us
about a number of things. Of course,
USMCA is the most imminent and
most up-front issue. Mexico just passed
the agreement.
I know we are having discussions to
see if we can find a path forward for
the House to move USMCA and get a
better deal with our partners, both on
the south and north, Canada and Mex-
ico.
They loaned us Lord Stanley’s cup.
We are going to loan them the NBA
trophy for a little while. But, beyond
those trade issues, we do, I think, have
some common ground on some trade
issues that had been needed to be re-
solved for a long time.
I know we are going to continue to
have those discussions, Mr. HOYER with
the White House, to hopefully get to a
point where we can, then, get that
agreement in place. But I do appreciate
that we had a very productive, bipar-
tisan meeting with the Canadian Prime
Minister, Mr. Trudeau, and we appre-
ciated that he was here on behalf of his
Nation.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman.
Mr. HOYER. I agree with the Repub-
lican whip that these were productive
meetings between Prime Minister
Trudeau and members of his cabinet:
the finance minister, the ambassador,
the foreign minister was there. I think
they were productive.
I think our side has made it very
clear that we want to get to yes. We
believe that the USMCA is an improve-
ment over existing NAFTA, and it also
accommodates for changes that have
occurred over the last 30 years or so.
We very much want to see, however,
that we have enforcement provisions in

the new agreement which apply to
workers, their safety, their standard of
living, and to the environment, as well
as some concerns about pharma-
ceuticals and biologics.
But we want to get to yes. Our
friends in labor want to get to yes. We
believe this is an improvement.
I am hopeful we can get enforcement
provisions. I know that Speaker PELOSI
has made it very clear what we need to
get to a yes, and I am hopeful we get
there because, personally, I think it
will be in the best interest of the coun-
try because it is an improvement over
the existing NAFTA.
That doesn’t mean it is perfect. None
of these agreements are perfect. But it
was a productive discussion and, hope-
fully, it will lead to solutions.
Mr. SCALISE. I am equally hopeful
we can get that resolved, and I appre-
ciate the gentleman’s work on that.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

ANGELIC HEALTH HOSPICE CARE
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker,
Angelic Health Hospice Care recently
cut the ribbon for their new head-
quarters in Atlantic County, New Jer-
sey.
Their staff provides palliative, hos-
pice, and transitional care services and
wound management to patients in
south Jersey. Although they have only
been operating for a short time, An-
gelic Health already employs over 200
employees, and they provide great care
to over 100 seniors.
What makes Angelic Health special
is that they go above and beyond for
their patients. They don’t make their
patients come to their facilities. They
go to them, whenever they can, to
wherever they can that their patients
call home.
They don’t only give care for their
patients; they also provide professional
support to the families. And they just
don’t treat physical ailments. Angelic
Health gives the patients social, spir-
itual, and emotional support as well.
I want to thank the staff and the vol-
unteers of Angelic Health who have
made our community a more loving
place for our seniors and for their fami-
lies. We are lucky to have them. They
have truly impacted lives in south Jer-
sey.

HONORING THE SACRIFICE OF
JOHN HETLAND AND KOU HER
(Mr. STEIL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, this
week, my southeast Wisconsin commu-
nity lost two heroes: Racine Police Of-
ficer John Hetland and Milwaukee Po-
lice Officer Kou Her.
Officer Hetland, a 24-year veteran of
the Racine Police Department, was
shot and killed while off duty, trying
to stop an armed robbery.
Officer Her, a 2-year veteran of the
Milwaukee Police Department, was
killed on his way home from a shift as
a speeding car crashed into him.
These men are heroes. They will al-
ways be remembered for their service.
This is a solemn reminder of the sac-
rifices members of our law enforcement
make every day to protect our commu-
nities.
My prayers are with the families and
friends of the officers and the entire
law enforcement community grieving
for these heroes.
f
URBAN GUN VIOLENCE
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker,
while I would love to rise in celebra-
tion of the first day of summer, the
cold, hard fact is that, as temperatures
soar, so does urban gun violence.
During a graduation party last week-
end in my district in southwest Phila-
delphia, a gunman opened fire, claim-
ing one life and injuring five other peo-
ple.
Last weekend, 23 separate shootings
claimed 32 victims and caused five
deaths in just 2 days in Philadelphia—
23 shootings and five deaths in one
weekend.
What is infuriating is that there are
proven, commonsense measures that
will reduce gun violence in our cities,
and the number one strategy is back-
ground checks.
115 days have passed since the House
sent two bipartisan, commonsense gun
safety bills to the Senate. They would
have strengthened our background
checks. And what has the Senate done?
Nothing.
During those 115 days, 11,400 people
have died from gun violence in the
United States.
Senator MCCONNELL likes to joke
about his legislative graveyard, but
countless families are actually burying
their loved ones while he does nothing.
The American people deserve better.
Our children deserve better.
f
CELEBRATING 50TH ANNIVERSARY
OF THE RICHMOND, INDIANA,
MUNICIPAL BUILDING
(Mr. PENCE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to celebrate the 50th anniversary
of the Richmond Municipal Building in
Richmond, Indiana.
This week, Richmond has the honor
of hosting the Indiana Conference of
Mayors, where over 70 hometown lead-
ers from across the State will come to-
gether to share ideas on how to better
serve Hoosiers in their communities.
The city has so much to be proud of,
and this occasion will give them an op-
portunity to showcase their hard work.
From upgrades to Veterans Park to
connectivity projects throughout the
Depot District, Richmond is an all-
American city with a small town
charm.
I want to congratulate the president
of the Indiana Conference of Mayors,
Mayor Dave Snow of Richmond, for his
hard work on behalf of all Hoosiers.
f
LGBTQ PRIDE MONTH
(Mr. ROUDA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in recognition of June as LGBTQ
Pride Month.
As we celebrate the contributions of
the LGBTQ community, we also know
that the fight for full equality under
the law is far from over.
I call on Majority Leader MITCH
MCCONNELL to respect the clear major-
ity of Americans who believe that
equality must become the law of the
land by taking up the Equality Act in
the Senate.
We also must do more to ensure that
we have the data necessary to enforce
key provisions in the Equality Act.
That is why I introduced the LGBTQ
Business Equal Credit Enforcement and
Investment Act, which would help fa-
cilitate fair lending to LGBTQ-owned
businesses and study the issues affect-
ing them by gathering data from finan-
cial institutions about their lending
practices toward these businesses.
If we are serious about our country’s
commitment to civil rights, protecting
minorities, and economic oppor-
tunity—and, for that matter, about
growing our economy—LGBTQ-owned
businesses must have access to equal
capital.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5027
June 21, 2019
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam
Speaker, today, I rise to advocate for
the brave men and women who defend
our country.
Recently, I visited Normandy,
France, for the 75th anniversary of D-
day. While overseas, I met numerous
men and women who were critical in
the defeat of fascism during World War
II, and they all gave me a very simple
and direct message: Go home and take
care of those who have served our Na-
tion proudly.
The conversations that I had with
the heroes from Normandy have in-
spired me this week to cosponsor nu-
merous legislative events. These will
positively affect our veterans.
Congress needs to pass the Agricul-
tural Apprenticeship Act, to allow vet-
erans to receive the training that they
need to enhance their employment op-
portunities.
We need to pass the Get Veterans a
Doctor Now Act, which allows the VA
to hire top talent so that our veterans
can get the best quality of healthcare.
And we need to pass the Veterans
Right to Expediency Act, so that the
veterans who have sustained injuries in
the field of battle cannot be boxed out
of filing disability claims.
Madam Speaker, it is time that we
take up these measures. Our veterans
have given everything for us.
f
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE
OF WILLIAM TULLY BROWN
(Mr. O’HALLERAN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to pay respects to a hero
and a warrior. William Tully Brown,
one of the last surviving Navajo code
talkers, passed away earlier this month
at the age of 96.
The code talkers were a group of
brave soldiers who used their native
tongue to create unbreakable codes in
the battlefield and to transmit mes-
sages during World War II. They par-
ticipated in every major Marine oper-
ation in the Pacific Theater, saving
hundreds of thousands of lives.
I was saddened to hear of the passing
of another decorated hero from this im-
portant group.
William was born in Black Mountain,
Arizona, in 1922, and enlisted in the
Marine Corps in 1944. During his serv-
ice, he received many military honors,
including the American Campaign
Medal and the Asiatic-Pacific Cam-
paign Medal.
We must never forget William Tully
Brown and all code talkers for their
service to our country and our vet-
erans’ service to their country.
f
HONORING DOROTHY ‘‘MOM’’
BROWN
(Mr. BAIRD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, today I
rise to honor Dorothy ‘‘Mom’’ Brown
for her dedication to the Phi Kappa Psi
house at DePauw University. Few indi-
viduals have had an impact on Phi
Kappa Psi as great as Dorothy, and we
thank her for her selflessness.
Prior to her time with Phi Kappa Psi,
Dorothy graduated from Indiana Uni-
versity, receiving a bachelor’s degree
in education and a master of science in
administration and supervision, and
then began a teaching career in Gary,
Indiana.
After serving as a principal in War-
ren Township Schools in Indianapolis
in the 1980s, Dorothy returned to her
home in Greencastle in 1986 to teach in
the Education Department at DePauw
University.
In 1993, Dorothy took a new role as
housemother of the Phi Kappa Psi fra-
ternity. She quickly became an anchor
for the fraternity and made it a memo-
rable experience for generations of
young men over the next 26 years.
She was honored in 2009 for her con-
tributions to DePauw by the city of
Greencastle, as the DePauw Cultural
Resource Center was renamed in her
honor.
Whether during her time as an ele-
mentary school teacher or fraternity
housemother, she exemplified leader-
ship and compassion, and I am proud to
call her a fellow Hoosier.
On behalf of the Fourth District of
Indiana, I thank her for her dedication
to her community, and I wish her the
very best in retirement.
f
HONORING THE LIFE OF CARL
BOYER
(Ms. HILL of California asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend her remarks.)
Ms. HILL of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life
of Carl Boyer.
The lives of every single person in
my hometown of Santa Clarita, Cali-
fornia, are better thanks to the work
and tireless efforts of one of our city’s
founding fathers, Mr. Carl Boyer.
After moving to what is now Califor-
nia’s 25th District in the late 1960s,
Carl worked to establish the city of
Santa Clarita in an effort to help our
community receive the resources it
needed. His leadership continued from
there as he served on the first-ever
Santa Clarita City Council and, even-
tually, two terms as mayor.
Carl put his city—our city—at the
center of every decision he made. From
his first day on the council to his last
day as mayor, he worked to protect our
beautiful open space, and he left office
having created one of the best park de-
partments in the United States.
While serving Santa Clarita, he was
also a public school teacher and a fos-
ter parent to young children who came
to the United States for lifesaving
medical treatment.
Carl Boyer had a heart of gold, and
will be missed by all. On behalf of the
vibrant and wonderful community that
he helped create, I extend my deepest
gratitude for the legacy of service, en-
gagement, and kindness that he leaves
behind.

HUMANITARIAN STANDARDS
(Mr. RUIZ asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to
urge a vote on my bill, the Humani-
tarian Standards for Individuals in
Customs and Border Protection Cus-
tody Act, an all-American, value-based,
comprehensive public health approach
to help CBP address the basic humani-
tarian needs of children and families
under their custody and responsibility.
When I visited our southern border, I
saw overworked agents and the melt-
down of a system that is understaffed,
under-equipped, under-resourced,
under-trained, and under-skilled to
meet the humanitarian needs of chil-
dren and families.
That is why my bill identifies hu-
manitarian standards on water, sanita-
tion, hygiene, nutrition, and shelter
missing from the administration’s
emergency supplemental budget re-
quest.
My bill requires a clearly defined
medical screening for all individuals in
CBP custody, and identifies priority
groups, like children and seniors, who
should receive their screenings within 3
hours of being detained by CBP.
It identifies how many calories a
pregnant woman or a child should be
given each day, for example, and it re-
quires that CBP provide toothbrushes
and diapers, the chance to bathe at
least once a day, and meets everyone’s
basic daily need to drink enough water.
Madam Speaker, I urge my fellow
representatives to support these
straightforward reforms to prevent the
deaths of children, and ensure our
treatment of women, children, and
families seeking asylum is consistent
with the basic principles of human dig-
nity.

porting research to comprehensively

portunities for prevention.
This funding is an important step

CONGRESSIONAL AWARD GOLD
MEDAL
(Ms. SPANBERGER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker,
central Virginia is home to some of the
most community-centered and service-
minded students in the country, and
yesterday I was fortunate to recognize
two of these students as winners of the
Congressional Award Gold Medal.
Two of my constituents, Kasey Mize
from Jeffersonton and Ciara Noelle
Smith from Chesterfield, earned this
national recognition for their respec-
tive work in community service, per-
sonal development, physical fitness,
and exploration of the world around
them.
Kasey’s community service centered
on organizing a sewing circle and pro-
viding more than 200 dresses a year to
impoverished girls around the world,
breaking down practical barriers that
keep many girls from attending
schools.
Ciara’s service to her community in-
volved volunteer hours spent working
at the Science Museum of Virginia and
constructing rehabilitation structures
for a central Virginia wildlife founda-
tion.
Both young people have dem-
onstrated an ability to set goals, make
a strategy, and see it through to the
end.
Madam Speaker, I congratulate
Kasey and Ciara on their accomplish-
ments. I look forward to seeing how
these two amazing young women will
continue contributing to our Seventh
District communities in the future.

HONORING ALVIN JONES
(Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend her remarks.)
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor
the life and memory of Alvin Francis
Jones, a lifelong New Mexican judge,
lawyer, and community leader.
Born in New Mexico in 1944, Alvin
earned a bachelor’s degree from New
Mexico Tech and a juris doctor from
the University of New Mexico.
He began his career in private prac-
tice and was later appointed to New
Mexico’s Fifth Judicial District in
Roswell, where he served for 19 years,
many as chief judge.
During his time on the bench, he
founded the local chapters of CASA to
help vulnerable children navigate the
State legal system, and Character
Counts, teaching children the value of
good character.
After retiring from the bench in 2004,
Alvin joined a private practice, where
he specialized in water law.
For me, he was a personal example of
character. He had a dogged work ethic,
and he also dedicated time and re-
sources to mentor New Mexicans.
A pillar of the community who was
loved by his family and friends alike,
Alvin leaves behind a legacy of selfless
service to New Mexico.
We are grateful and will miss him
dearly.

MEDICAID CLIFF
(Mr. SABLAN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, the
Mariana Islands and four other U.S. in-
sular areas face a Medicaid ‘‘cliff’’.
Funding included in the Patient Pro-
tection and Affordable Care Act expires
this year.
Two-thirds of our annual Medicaid
funding disappears, gone, putting
healthcare at risk not just for Medicaid
recipients, but for everyone who uses
our hospital or other providers, be-
cause they depend as well on Medicaid
revenues to stay in business or open.
I held a hearing last month on this
Medicaid cliff. Chair ESHOO held a
hearing yesterday, for which I am
grateful.
This attention is good. We need Con-
gress to focus on this impending
healthcare crisis for Americans living
in the insular areas.
Certainly, more money is needed.
Treat the insular areas like the States.
But the goal is not just money.
What we want is medical care for
those who need it in the insular areas
to be every bit as good as medical care
anywhere in America.

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO
NORTH KOREA—MESSAGE FROM
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 116–44)
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message
from the President of the United
States; which was read and, together
with the accompanying papers, referred
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs
and ordered to be printed:
To the Congress of the United States:
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. l622(d)) provides
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90
days before the anniversary date of its
declaration, the President publishes in
the Federal Register and transmits to
the Congress a notice stating that the
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to
the Federal Register for publication the
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to North
Korea that was declared in Executive
Order 13466 of June 26, 2008, expanded in

The existence and risk of prolifera-
tion of weapons-usable fissile material
on the Korean Peninsula; the actions
and policies of the Government of
North Korea that destabilize the Ko-
rean Peninsula and imperil United
States Armed Forces, allies, and trad-
ing partners in the region, including its
pursuit of nuclear and missile pro-
grams; and other provocative, desta-
bilizing, and repressive actions and
policies of the Government of North
Korea, continue to constitute an un-
usual and extraordinary threat to the
national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States. For this
reason, I have determined that it is
necessary to continue the national
emergency declared in Executive Order
13466 with respect to North Korea.

ISSUES OF THE DAY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. GOHMERT) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority
leader.
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I
have comments about my giving re-
marks at the end of the week, so it
might be worth setting a little history
of these Special Order remarks.
In 2005 and 2006, my first term, I was
not prone to give any remarks in Spe-
cial Orders, but I observed during those
2 years that one of my classmates that
came in January 2005, like I did,
DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, and some
other Democrats arranged each night,
often taking both hours of Special Or-
ders that their party was afforded.
I was told by Republicans who had
been here for a long time, ‘‘You know,

nobody is paying any attention to what
they are saying. They are making
themselves look bad. They make us
look good by what they say.’’
There were times I would say, ‘‘But
are you paying attention to what they
are saying?’’
You could see on C–SPAN sometimes
when the sound was off, it would be
scrolling, and I would say, ‘‘Look what
they are saying. They are blaming us
for all kinds of things. We need to re-
spond. This isn’t accurate.’’
And I was told, ‘‘Look, you know,
don’t worry about it. It doesn’t make
any difference.’’
And over the course of 2 years, I saw
that a group that called themselves the
30 Somethings—everyone that was
probably in their sixties or seventies,
but otherwise in their thirties—that
they did affect national opinion. I
mean, you could see over that many
nights, they made a difference.
After that, I endeavored to try to ad-
dress some of the critical issues when I
had the chance, if other Members of my
party were not taking those opportuni-
ties.
So on fly-out days, when so many are
rushing and have to get to the airport
by a certain time, they don’t have time
to come down here and address some of
our critical issues, then I volunteer. I
will stay an extra hour or two before
catching a plane back to Texas in order
to address some of these important
things. And it is a great opportunity.
I used to do more than one Special
Order a week many times, but my
Democrat friend, and I mean that sin-
cerely, JOHN GARAMENDI, had referred
to a new Democrat rule that was put in
place this year that no one could take
more than one Special Order during the
week, my friend, JOHN, referred to that
as the Louie Gohmert rule.
The good thing about that was that
it enabled me not to just continue as I
had been year after year encouraging
other Republicans to take a Special
Order and address some of these impor-
tant national issues, then I was able
this year to tell them, ‘‘Look, I can
only do one a week, so you guys have
got to start signing up for Special Or-
ders and taking the time, addressing
areas that you know well that we need
to communicate about.’’
So I have been very pleased with how
many of my colleagues have signed up
for Special Orders and addressed crit-
ical issues, helped educate on the mat-
ters before us, because you don’t al-
ways get straight and accurate news
even by some of the so-called fact-
checkers.
Often fact-checkers, as they call
themselves, need fact-checking, be-
cause many times they are not accu-
rate either.
b 1215
So this is a great opportunity that
we have in a legislative body to address
issues so that information does get out
to the public, unless they are reading
the remarks in some article that has
had the facts and statements twisted
and edited to change the meaning. Oth-
erwise, they can judge for themselves
exactly what has been said and what is
accurate and what isn’t.
I heard our Majority Leader HOYER
and our Minority Whip SCALISE and
their dialogue back and forth bringing
up the critical issue of our border and
the humanitarian crisis going on there.
In their discussion, they did not get
into what is causing—well, I guess they
referred to it. People are trying to get
away from terrible circumstances.
Well, those circumstances in dif-
ferent places in the world have gone on
for centuries. We have never had the
kind of mass effort at entrance that we
have seen in recent months.
So, things haven’t gotten worse in
the world. Why the huge surge at our
border this year? And the border pa-
trolmen with whom I communicate,
the people who are dealing with those
coming in illegally, coming through
places that are not legal ports of entry,
the border patrolmen get information
from immigrants exactly why they are
coming.
Sometimes immigrants are given
pieces of paper—the immigrants com-
ing in illegally—with addresses, names,
and these are either approved or given
by the drug cartels. Nobody comes into
the United States across our southern
border without permission of the drug
cartels.
The drug cartels are not interested in
preventing humanitarian crises. Drug
cartels are interested in helping create
humanitarian crises. And since I have
been there all hours of the night, which
used to be the prime time for people
coming across illegally—now they are
just coming all the time—I got to see
this so many times firsthand.
I have even seen, numerous times,
people that had their little piece of
paper. It was supposed to be the ad-
dress that they gave the Border Patrol
and, later, ICE: Yes, this is the address
where I have somebody waiting for me,
somebody who knows me, a family
member.
Often that information was provided
by the drug cartels: This is where you
will go.
This actually fit together to help an-
swer mysteries of who is telling them
where to go.
But the immigrants would be asked
by Border Patrol, and it wasn’t on the
list of questions they are required to
ask: How much did you pay the gang or
the drug cartels that are responsible
for bringing you in? Because some-
times the drug cartels have gang mem-
bers who will act as coyotes and bring
people in illegally. And the answer is,
normally, $6,000, $7,000, $8,000.
And the question follow-up: Where
did you get that kind of money? You
don’t have that kind of money.
Well, we have got $1,000 or $1,500 here,
and then people in the U.S. send us
some money.
Well, what about the rest of it?
And the disturbing comment was,
normally: They are going to let me
work that off when I get where I am
going.
Well, these are drug cartels, and ob-
viously the work they were going to be
doing would be either drug trafficking
or sex trafficking, both doing severe
damage to our country. Yet we have
not been able to reach passage of a bill,
bipartisan or otherwise, that would ac-
tually help totally secure our border so
we can control who comes in and en-
sure that they are not people who are
wanting to do damage to the country.
Now, some just want to come in the
country, and they don’t realize, by
coming in, they will do damage, that
they have not been educated on how
you keep, how you retain a representa-
tive form of government and how with
the liberties and freedoms come great
responsibilities.
The responsibilities portion has also
been neglected in so many schools. It is
all about rights without getting into
responsibilities.
But I will continue to bring up Ben
Franklin’s answer to the woman after
the Constitutional Convention: Sir,
what have you given us?
A republic, madam, if you can keep
it.
Eric Metaxas has a book on this that
I read recently. It is very difficult to
keep a self-governing system going.
Historically, any attempt at some type
of self-government has not lasted nor-
mally more than 200 years. We are be-
yond that.
The Constitution was ratified and
first elected a Congress, President, and
Vice President under the Constitution
of 1787 that finished being ratified in
1789. So we are 230 years beyond that
founding document being ratified. So
we are beyond the number of years
that a self-government has been able to
last in the past, normally.
The fact is there haven’t been normal
self-governments, and that is why, in
Ben Franklin’s speech at the Constitu-
tional Convention, although kids are
taught today in school that he was a
deist, if Franklin is even mentioned at
all—a deist believing there is maybe
some force, some thing, some whatever
out there that created things, and if
such force or person or being or deity
existed and still exists, it never inter-
feres with nature or the things that
were set in motion originally. That is,
in essence, a shorthand rendition of a
deist.
But Franklin himself, we know what
he said, because he wrote it down when
people asked for a copy. He said: I have
lived, sir, a long time, and the longer I
live the more convincing proofs I see of
this truth. God governs in the affairs of
man.
This means he wasn’t a deist.
But he says: If a sparrow cannot fall
to the ground without His notice, is it
possible an empire could rise without
His aid? We have been assured, sir, in
the sacred writing, that unless the
Lord builds this House, they labor in
vain to build it.
He said: I firmly believe this. I also
firmly believe without His concurring

aid, we shall succeed in our political
building no better than the builders of
Babel. We will be confounded by our
partial local interests, and we, our-
selves, shall become a bower down
through the ages.
Because Franklin knew. He studied
history along with science and other
things, but he knew from history this
is not something that had been effec-
tively done the way they were wanting
to do it.
Sure, the Romans had had a Senate.
The Greeks had made an effort at de-
mocracy that worked for a short
time—not well, but worked for a short
time.
The British, from whom we sepa-
rated, they had a Parliament, but they
also had a king. This was going to be a
new thing. And the ‘‘Novus ordo
seclorum’’ that is under the pyramid
on the two-sided Great Seal that was
adopted over 200 years ago, ‘‘Novus
ordo seclorum,’’ Latin, meaning, ‘‘new
order of things,’’ ‘‘new order of the
ages.’’
Some have tried to say: A-ha, new
world order.
But if you look at the Founders’ own
remarks, they make it clear that they
knew nobody had really gotten this
self-government thing right. But if
they could do it right—and as Franklin
said, it wasn’t going to happen right
without the Lord’s concurring aid.
But if they could get it right, this
would be a new order of things. This
would be what people around the world,
for the rest of history, would probably
try to emulate, if not outright imitate.
But if they didn’t get it right, since
they had the opportunity and failed, as
Franklin said, they would become a
bower down through the ages. They
would be ridiculed. They had the
chance to do self-government right,
and they blew it.
But even though they got this thing
incredibly right, the founding docu-
ment and the agreed upon 10 Amend-
ments, the Bill of Rights, obviously it
has taken a couple hundred years to
get the Constitution to apply and mean
what it says. It took a Civil War. It
took a civil rights movement. But here
we are today, and we have not contin-
ued to educate people on what Frank-
lin knew would require education in
order to keep the Republic.
Oh, sure, we have got more schools
now than ever, but because of the
heavy-handedness of the Federal Gov-
ernment Department of Education,
even though that education is some-
thing that is not an enumerated power
in the Constitution and, therefore,
under the Tenth Amendment was re-
served for rights only of the States and
the local government, the Federal Gov-
ernment got involved and, as a result,
not many students are being taught
the complete history that they should
know and they need to know in order
to sustain this little experiment in
self-government.
So when people come in and they
have not been educated at all on what
it takes to keep a self-governing sys-
tem, they are just told in their own
language about all of the free things
they can get, they are not told about
the important responsibilities that
come with those free things and oppor-
tunities, that keeps up for so long, and
there is no bright light on a hill that
draws people from around the world.
Then, as some West Africans told me,
when America gets weak, we suffer.
And we are seeing that around the
world.
Iranians are suffering tremendously
under a heavy-handed, even criminal,
terrorist regime in Iran that came into
place because we had a President who
didn’t understand radical Islam, did
not understand that when he turned his
back on the Shah, who was not a great
guy—he apparently did not treat his
people as well as they should have
been—nonetheless, things certainly got
worse.
When the Ayatollah was welcomed
into power by President Carter as a
man of peace, well, the world soon
found that Iran, now that radical
Islamists who wanted a new caliphate
for the world to subjugate Christians
and every other religious group under
their mean-spirited, actually, dictator-
ship as a religious dictatorship, the
people of Iran suffered. The world has
suffered from the failure during the
Carter administration to understand
the dangers that were lurking there.
Well, those dangers are no longer lurk-
ing there. They are being spread
around the world.
I was amazed to hear people on tele-
vision say, well, they couldn’t really
say if Iran had caused the death of any
Americans. Certainly they have.
Not long after the Ayatollah Kho-
meini took over in Iran, our Embassy
was attacked and over 50 individuals
were taken hostage. But they have con-
tinued to support terrorism, unabated,
over all these years since 1979.
b 1230
They are responsible for the deaths
and the explosions at the Marine bar-
racks in Beirut in 1983. And the mes-
sage that was sent by the Democratic
majority in the House and Senate was
to force the complete withdrawal of
troops in the area.
So that was a great encouragement
to the Ayatollah and to the radical
Islamists that want to destroy self-gov-
ernment. They think that they need a
dictator who is really a religious bigot
in control of things to dictate to people
what they can or can’t do, and that is
such a foreign concept after 230 years
here under our Constitution.
But anybody who studies history,
who is up on his history, knows there is
a lot better chance that a dictatorship
will eventually prevail, whether it is a
religious extremist like you have rul-
ing in Iran or it is just a dictator like
you have had in the Soviet Union.
So having been in the Soviet Union
for a summer as an exchange student
between my sophomore and junior year
of college, I saw the way people suf-
fered. I saw the way the government
spied on its people; I saw the mean-
spirited things the government did to
people that weren’t being manipulated
the way they wanted them to be; I saw
suppression of free thought and free ex-
change of ideas; and I came home lit-
erally thanking God that we didn’t
have that kind of suppressive govern-
ment.
But in the intervening years, we have
seen a government get so powerful that
it can spy on its own people, and we
saw with what was released by
WikiLeaks, the FISA application, the
underlying affidavit, and the order
that—holy cow, the FISA judge just
basically ignored the Fourth Amend-
ment, the protections against unwar-
ranted searches and seizures.
The application, my interpretation,
was basically it said: We just need all
of the information Verizon has on
every customer they have and an un-
derlying affidavit saying, basically,
yeah, we just need every bit of infor-
mation Verizon has on every customer.
And then the judge—even though a
Federal, Senate-confirmed judge, it is a
secret court—he just signs off on it:
Oh, you want every bit of information
Verizon has on every single customer?
Sure, yeah. Why don’t you provide
that? Here, here is an order to provide
it.
That scared me because it actually
confirmed what some of us had feared
back when the Patriot Act was being
reauthorized in my first term: Wait a
minute. This is giving the Federal Gov-
ernment power that could go too far.
There is language that is too loosely
written that could allow the govern-
ment to spy on people without proper
authority.
We have got to revisit those issues.
And that has been further brought to
a head with what we are learning about
the abuses of the FISA court when one
administration wanted to spy on a
campaign and then spy on—and, hope-
fully, eliminate—the selection of a ma-
jority of the electoral college.
The electoral college itself under-
went some evolution back in the early
days, because, originally, it was a bril-
liant idea. It was a way of ensuring
that both heavily populated States and
lesser-populated States would all be
relevant in a national election for our
President and Vice President.
Unfortunately, in the beginning, the
second highest vote getter became the
Vice President, and that became appar-
ent as a failure and a bad idea under
the Presidency of John Adams, when
Jefferson, his dear friend, became Vice
President with the second highest
number of votes. By the end of the
fourth year, as McCullough points out
in his book on John Adams, Jefferson
even hired a notorious newspaperman
to make up some lies about Adams to
help him defeat him, which he did,
which probably explains why Adams is
the only President who didn’t stick

around for the inauguration of his suc-
cessor. But that got changed to a con-
stitutional amendment, and so we have
the electoral process.
If you do away with the electoral col-
lege, then it would mean most every
State that is not a heavily populated
State will never see a candidate run-
ning for President, because it would be
a waste. They will want to spend their
time in the heavy population centers
and mainly disregard what some people
refer to as flyover States, which many
of us feel are the real guts and the
heart of the country.
So it is an important thing to have,
but people are not getting education on
these things these days, and why
things were created the way in which
they were, what succeeded, what failed.
When I do tours around the Capitol,
sometimes they go a lot longer than I
think they should, but I am ready to
stop any time the people are, but they
still have questions. We find so many
people haven’t gotten the education.
I hear so often: I never really liked
history in school.
Well, that doesn’t tell me anything
about them. It tells me a lot about
their history teachers, that they had
history teachers who didn’t understand
the importance of history, so they had
true/false, multiple choice, or fill-in-
the-bank questions rather than empha-
sizing that the real importance in his-
tory is the stories, what went right,
what went wrong.
Yes, it helps to have them in chrono-
logical order, but the more important
aspect is what worked and what didn’t.
And that is not what so many Amer-
ican students are getting anymore.
And certainly those who are rushing
into America illegally, they certainly
haven’t gotten that. They know Amer-
ica is supposed to be a better place, but
they don’t know why. They don’t know
that they are jeopardizing that coun-
try’s ability to continue as an attrac-
tive place for people to want to go, the
most attractive place for immigrants
to want to come in the entire world.
So we have got more education to do.
And I am hoping that our colleagues
here in this body will begin to under-
stand that, when we take up legislation
that will ultimately legalize illegal ac-
tivity—like coming into the country il-
legally or giving benefits for coming in
illegally—it becomes a lure for more
and more people to come illegally,
which means it is going to make more
money for the drug cartels. It is going
to have more young women raped.
We are told that is occurring. About
one in four girls coming to the United
States through Mexico will end up
being sexually assaulted, little boys at
a lesser rate. I think I read 17 percent,
something like that—just human trag-
edy.
It happens when well-meaning indi-
viduals in Congress think: Let’s help
those less fortunate by luring them to
our country, not understanding that
there is a tremendous amount of
human suffering that goes on, in addi-
tion to undermining the very founda-
tion of what was the freest country in
the world.
So everybody is now indicating that
America is not the freest country in
the world. We continue to add laws
that keep taking more and more of our
freedoms away. But I heard the major-
ity leader ruing that we haven’t had
comprehensive immigration reform.
Well, in my time in Congress, what I
have come to understand is, when you
hear the term ‘‘comprehensive immi-
gration reform,’’ it normally means we
want a bill that is so big and so mas-
sive that people who will vote on it
won’t have a chance to read it all and
will be able to stick things in there
that a majority would never agree to if
they knew they were there. That is
what I have come to see ‘‘comprehen-
sive’’ meaning when it comes to legis-
lation.
We are better off if we take subjects
up individually, let people have a
chance to read and know what is there,
let them have a chance to analyze the
language. Is this something likely to
be struck down? If we don’t have that
opportunity, we pass legislation that is
not what we want as a majority.
And as a majority—obviously, I am a
Republican. We are in the minority.
But I am talking about a majority of
this body.
So we have these ongoing offers,
which is what it is every time we pass
a piece of legislation, even if it doesn’t
become law. That word is used by the
drug cartels to encourage more people
to pay them, to bring them in. That
means they are going to have more em-
ployees—really, more like indentured
servants—in the drug trade, in the
human trafficking, sex trafficking
trade, and people suffer as a result of
well-intentioned but poorly thought-
out legislation. We have got to do a
better job on that.
Unfortunately, in the last term of
Congress when Republicans had a ma-
jority in the House and the Senate, had
a Republican President, we had leader-
ship in both Houses that was not inter-
ested in securing our border or we
could have passed a bill to do that. We
could have passed a bill and gotten it
into law.
But there are monied interests out
there that contribute heavily and en-
courage people not to secure the bor-
der. Of course, I said before from this
lectern, if you hear somebody who is
elected in Mexico say, ‘‘We don’t want
the border secure; we don’t want a wall
anywhere on our border with the
United States: Then you know that is
someone who is getting money from
the drug cartels. You can take that to
the bank.
But you also heard well-intentioned
but uneducated or miseducated individ-
uals talk about what is happening on
our border and even refer to the efforts
to care for those who have come in ille-
gally as concentration camps. If that
were so, it would be the first time in
human history that people have
flocked by the hundreds of thousands
to voluntarily go into concentration
camps, because that has never hap-
pened in the history of the world.
The Jews, during the 1930s and 1940s
did not go flocking by their own choice
into concentration camps that resulted
in over 6 million deaths. They were
forced into those.
The people who are coming volun-
tarily and illegally across our border,
they are putting themselves at risk of
sexual exploitation but also even for
their very lives, because we constantly
get reports about people dying trying
to get in or getting in illegally and
then being left by coyotes out some-
where to die.
We constantly, if you pay attention,
get reports of our Border Patrol saving
the lives—ICE agents—saving the lives
of people who have come in illegally
but have been abandoned by the drug
cartels’ coyotes.
So it is also interesting when you
think about the facilities on our bor-
ders.
b 1245
The concentration camps of World
War II did not have Germany appro-
priating billions of dollars or their
equivalent for them to have a more
comfortable existence. That didn’t hap-
pen.
That is why, clearly, they are not
concentration camps, as people con-
tinue to flock there by the hundreds of
thousands knowing what they are
going into. But as they continue to
hear that we are passing laws that will
eventually allow them to be legalized if
they come illegally, we are going to
have the numbers that we are seeing
there at this time.
In the past, we have been told that
they feel like they are catching most of
the people coming across. But if my
colleagues spend a lot of time on the
border as I have, the Border Patrol will
say that what scares them is that they
don’t know what they don’t know
about the people coming in.
They do know that every time a big
group comes across our border illegally
and makes themselves available to be
picked up and detained, that the drug
cartels know. We have to put all of our
people on duty trying to in-process
these folks, and that is when the drug
cartels know they can bring in big
shipments of drugs, bring in people who
otherwise may be a threat to our coun-
try.
We continue to hear from Federal of-
ficials about people coming. We just
had a report in the last couple of weeks
about the ISIS member who admitted
that they are continuing to get radical
Islamists who want to destroy our
country into our country through our
southern border by paying the drug
cartels to bring them in with other
people. That is all going on.
Then comes this article yesterday
from The Washington Times, Stephen
Dinan, that says, ‘‘The Border Patrol
has documented more than 100,000 im-
migrants who they know managed to

cy’s Chief told Congress on Thursday,
saying it’s the most in 5 years.’’
Just for reference here, we do have
balloons that can be floated up that
have infrared or thermal technology,
night vision. We have people on the
border with night vision, thermal tech-
nology, so they can see the outline of
individuals who get in, even when they
are not caught.

are ones who agents detect but know
they didn’t manage to stop from cross-
ing the border.’’
I need to insert here that our Border
Patrol for a number of administrations
has not been allowed to prevent people
from coming into our country. We need
to fix the law so they can prevent peo-
ple from coming into the country using
reasonable means.
I know when the Texas Department
of Public Safety has their boats out on
the Rio Grande where people are cross-
ing, they don’t cross because Texas
DPS doesn’t allow people to cross into
Texas illegally if they can stop them.
The Border Patrol, on the other
hand, has their hands tied. They have
to allow them to come in illegally and
then try to in-process them.
This article goes on. It says: ‘‘ ‘This
high level of ‘‘got aways’’ is a direct re-
sult of agents being reassigned away
from the front line to provide humani-
tarian support to the unprecedented
numbers of individuals and families in
custody,’ Chief Carla Provost told the
House Homeland Security Committee.
‘‘The panel was meeting to hear how
President Trump’s orders to send Na-
tional Guard and Active Duty troops to
the border is playing out. Chief Provost
said they’ve been a major boost, sug-
gesting the got-away numbers might
have been worse without the troops
there to fill gaps left when her agents
get pulled away to do babysitting du-
ties for the families and unaccom-
panied children.’’
I have gotten pictures from our bor-
der of our actual Border Patrol pushing
baby carriages, literally babysitting
because these folks have been lured in
by what we are doing here, what we are
talking about here.
Chief Provost goes on to say, ‘‘ ‘That
support as my agents are being pulled
away to deal with the humanitarian
crisis is key to us having situational
awareness on the border,’ she said.’’
The article says, further down: ‘‘In
one example last month, National
Guard troops in Texas spotted a group
of migrants rafting across the Rio
Grande and reported it to Border Pa-
trol agents. Agents, with the help of
local police, corralled the group, whose
members had paid up to $10,000 to be
smuggled into the U.S.’’
It says they corralled them, but what
I didn’t get until I started spending a
lot of time on the border is that that
doesn’t mean they stopped them. It
means they in-processed them into the
United States.
Anyway, this article makes clear it
is not even just the people who are
coming in at a record pace this year.
But just in 1 month, they think there
may have been 100,000 people who came
in that were not in-processed. They
just came into the United States. Who
knows if they want to do evil or good,
but they certainly wanted to engage in
illegal activity.
Another article here from Adam
Shaw, ‘‘Illegal Immigrants from 52
Countries Crossed the U.S.-Mexico Bor-
der this Year.’’ That is just so far. We
are in June.
‘‘The U.S. Border Patrol Chief testi-
fied Thursday that migrants from 52
countries have illegally crossed the
border this year as she described an
agency ‘overwhelmed on a daily basis’
by the escalating crisis.’’
She said, ‘‘ ‘While smugglers pri-
marily target the Northern Triangle,
family units from 52 countries have il-
legally crossed the southern border so
far this year.’ ’’
Further down, it says: ‘‘A Senate
panel on Wednesday approved a $4.6 bil-
lion request for funding to tackle the
humanitarian crisis at the border, but
only after including a condition that
none of the money be used for a border
wall.’’
As I understand our majority leader’s
discussion today, they are talking
about emergency funding to deal with
the humanitarian crisis, but actually,
the way it is being talked about, it will
contribute to the crisis because it will
encourage more people who we are
spending a new $4.5 or $4.6 billion on, to
provide food and comfortable shelter
for people who come in illegally.
That language is being drafted to en-
sure not only that it not be spent on
the wall, but that it is not going to be
spent at all on preventing people from
coming in illegally. It is just going to
be spent on the more and more volumes
that are coming in illegally, which
will, in this cyclical, worthless effort,
encourage more to come in. We will
have to appropriate billions and bil-
lions more for a bigger humanitarian
crisis, and that will encourage more.
At some point, we have to take seri-
ously, and I know there are a lot of
people who don’t like Biblical ref-
erences—not very many, but some—but
the fact is that it is the most quoted
book in the history of our country. It
was the most quoted book during the
Constitutional Convention, and it con-
tinues to be the most quoted book in
Congress.
If my colleagues look back in the Old
Testament references, in Psalms, Prov-
erbs, and other places, the best that we
can hope and pray for is justice where
the rich are treated like everybody
else. They don’t get any special consid-
eration. And the poor are treated like
everybody else and not given any spe-
cial consideration. Everyone is treated
fairly and equally under the law.
Yet, what we are seeing in this effort
is that we are going to treat people
who are trying to come into this coun-
try legally, we are going to penalize
them. We are going to make them take
7 to 10 years, as some have, that we
have tried to help family members
with before.
But if they will just come illegally,
we are going to treat them specially.
We are going to ship them to a place
the drug cartels want them to be to
work as their employees or indentured
servants. We are going to treat them
specially. We are going to give them all
kinds of things that people who are
still waiting in foreign countries to get
approval to come legally are not get-
ting and will not get because they are
trying to do things the legal way, while
others are flooding the zone illegally.
That is not a good scenario for a
country to continue to keep a self-gov-
erning system. Of course, we have bil-
lionaires that have donated large
amounts of money to try to push us
into being a socialist system. Of
course, Marx didn’t foresee the growth
of a middle class the way we have had
it here in the United States.
I continue to think that is the real
strength of our country, the huge mid-
dle class. It shrank during the Obama
administration when, for the first time
in our history, 95 percent of the new in-
come one year went to the top 1 per-
cent income earners. The middle class
shrunk. The poorest got poorer; the
rich got richer; and the middle class
shrunk.
That could end up leading to a com-
munist revolution once we get to hav-
ing that small ruling class and then
the much larger poor class. Unfortu-
nately, for the billionaires that con-
tribute to help take us to a socialist
system, they haven’t been educated in
history adequately to understand that
if we go to a socialist system, nor-
mally, the billionaires’ money is
taken. They are put in prison or killed,
and they don’t end up being part of the
elite ruling class as they had been so
hopeful of.
We do have a crisis on our southern
border, but it needs to be while we deal
in a humane way with people who are
here, that we also secure our border be-
cause otherwise, we are not a nation. If
we don’t have a border that is enforce-
able, we are not a nation. We are just
a transient area. And if there is wealth
in the area, it will not continue on for
many more decades.
We had a hearing this week, changing
gears, on the issue of reparations. It
has been amazing how miseducated
people have been on slavery, who sup-
ported it, who was against it; on civil
rights, who supported it, who was
against it. It has really been amazing.

There is an article here from Jeffrey
Lord in The American Spectator from
June 21.
It says: ‘‘So amidst the chaos of that

this, as reported by BizPac Review:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5033
June 21, 2019
‘I used to be a Democrat until I did
my history and found out the misery
that that party brought to my race,’
Owens said.
‘‘He added, ‘I do believe in restitu-
tion. Let’s point to the party that was
part of slavery, KKK, Jim Crow, that
has killed over 40 percent of our Black
babies, 20 million of them. State of
California, 75 percent of our Black boys
can’t pass standard reading and writing
test, a Democratic State. Let’s pay
reparation. Let’s pay restitution. How
about a Democratic Party pay for all
the misery brought to my race.’ ’’
The article by Mr. Lord says: ‘‘Bingo.
Yet somehow, some mysterious way,
the hard facts of history are blithely
ignored by members and sycophants of
the Democrats, the latter without
doubt the party of race.
‘‘Republican Congressman LOUIE
GOHMERT of Texas had the audacity to
quote from a 2008 article of mine that
originally appeared in this space and
was reprinted in The Wall Street Jour-
nal. Among other things in that article
I noted these hard facts about what
was missing from the website of the
Democratic National Committee as it
tried to portray itself as the champion
of civil rights by leaving out the hard
facts of the party’s horrendous actual
history on race.’’
Madam Speaker, these are the things
he correctly notes that I read into the
RECORD at our hearing.
This is from the Democrats’ ‘‘Our
History’’ section of their website.
He said: ‘‘There is no reference to the
number of Democratic Party platforms
supporting slavery.
‘‘There were six from 1840 to 1860.
‘‘There is no reference to the number
of Democratic Presidents who owned
slaves.
‘‘There were seven from 1800 to 1861.
‘‘There is no reference to the number
of Democratic Party platforms that ei-
ther supported segregation outright or
were silent on the subject.
‘‘There were 20, from 1868 through
1948.
‘‘There is no reference to ‘Jim Crow’
as in ‘Jim Crow laws,’ nor is there ref-
erence to the role Democrats played in
creating them. These were the post-
Civil War laws passed enthusiastically
by Democrats in that pesky 52-year
part of the DNC’s missing years. These
laws segregated public schools, public
transportation, restaurants, restrooms,
and public places in general, every-
thing from water coolers to beaches.
The reason Rosa Parks became famous
is that she sat in the ‘whites only’
front section of a bus, the ‘whites only’
designation the direct result of Demo-
crats.
‘‘There is no reference to the forma-
tion of the Ku Klux Klan, which, ac-
cording to Columbia University histo-
rian Eric Foner, became ‘a military
force serving the interests of the
Democratic Party.’ Nor is there ref-
erence to University of North Carolina
historian Allen Trelease’s description
of the Klan as the ‘terrorist arm of the
Democratic Party.’
‘‘There is no reference to the fact
Democrats opposed the 13th, 14th, and
15th Amendments to the Constitution.
The 13th banned slavery.’’
Madam Speaker, on further down:
‘‘There is no reference to the fact that
Democrats opposed the Civil Rights
Act of 1866. It was passed by the Repub-
lican Congress over the veto of Presi-
dent Andrew Johnson, who had been a
Democrat before joining Lincoln’s
ticket in 1864.
‘‘There is no reference to the Demo-
crat’s opposition to the Civil Rights
Act of 1875.’’
Anyway, Madam Speaker, it goes on
and on here. But it was amazing to me
and this article points out: ‘‘Tellingly,
when Congressman GOHMERT was fin-
ished reciting these hard, cold, and
quite accurate facts of history, some-
one in the audience yelled out, ‘You
lie.’ An unwitting admission of abso-
lute historical ignorance or maybe just
plain denial. And over at the website
Splinter writer Samantha Grasso as-
sailed Gohmert as the ‘dumbest Repub-
lican in the room’ for daring to cite the
Democrats’ appalling historical
record.’’
So anyway, Madam Speaker, it is an
interesting time. Education is impor-
tant, but it has got to be accurate edu-
cation.
One other thing I would like to
quickly reference is the need for crimi-
nal justice reform within our military.
There are some aspects of military jus-
tice that are very good.
In the grand jury process in the civil-
ian sector, constitutionally the defend-
ant, potential defendant, is not allowed
to be there, nor to have his attorney
there or her attorney. Attorneys are
not allowed to be there for a potential
defendant when that potential defend-
ant is actually testifying before the
grand jury.
Whereas, in the military system of
justice, under the Uniform Code of
Military Justice, there is what is called
an Article 32 investigation which is
sort of the equivalent, except a poten-
tial accused, as we call them in the
military, is allowed to be there and
have an attorney there to see what is
being said against him and to give a
chance to present evidence to the Arti-
cle 32 investigating officer.
But one of the problems—and it is a
very, very serious problem—is that the
charges are sent to a court-martial by
the commander, normally a com-
manding general or admiral. He is
called the convening authority. He
puts his signature on there saying: I
want this individual charged and tried
in a court-martial for this offense.
That is after reviewing the results of
the Article 32 investigation.
But where it becomes rather unfair is
that to get a jury—I saw this during
my 4 years at Fort Benning—the com-
manding general has each unit—we
have platoons that make up companies.
Platoons would offer suggestions of
hard-nosed guys that would convict
anybody who was sent if they were on
the jury, and they were referred up to
the company commander. The com-
pany commander would choose those
that he thought were the very best out
of those nominated, and he would refer
them up to the battalion commander.
The battalion commander would win-
now that group down to the very
toughest who would follow what the
commander would want them to do and
send those up to brigade. The brigade
would take them and review them and
decide to get it down to a number that
they would send up, and eventually it
would get to the commanding general
of installation, and he would pick
maybe up to 15 people who would sit,
sometimes for 6 months, on every
court-martial during that time.
They knew why they were there.
They knew why the commanding gen-
eral put them on the jury. They were
sent there to convict the guys that the
general sent to be tried.
There were a number of acquittals,
but I can tell you every time there was
an acquittal in a court-martial, you
never saw that jury panel again. They
may have been new, but if they acquit-
ted somebody, found them not guilty,
the general immediately disbanded
them as a jury panel. It is not like you
have jury selection where you can chal-
lenge somebody and have them taken
off the jury.
I remember one court-martial where
virtually all of the jury said that if a
defendant did not testify, they would
hold it against him and find him guilty
just because he didn’t testify.
The judge said: Hey, we are all part
of this man’s Army, and if I instruct
you—and I will instruct you—that you
will not hold it against the defendant
that he doesn’t testify, will you follow
my direct order not to consider it
against?
Oh, oh, okay. Sure. We didn’t know
you were going to instruct us not to.
But they had already made clear
that, yeah, they are going to hold it
against him.
So a defendant’s constitutional
rights in a military court-martial can
sometimes be illusory. I think we are
seeing that with Eddie Gallagher out in
California. Even after a witness came
forward and said that he is the one who
asphyxiated the deceased who was
wounded, he was an ISIS member, that
Eddie Gallagher didn’t kill him, they
still continue on with the court-mar-
tial.
From what I saw at Fort Benning, if
you had somebody come in and say: ‘‘I
am actually the one who did it,’’ I have
seen a good military judge say then:
Mr. Prosecutor, do you have a motion
to dismiss at this time?
And they would make a motion to
dismiss.
But, really, I have a great deal of
concern. I saw in a brief that someone
had prepared for a parole matter that
there was out of World Wars I and II,
Korea, and Vietnam, it said there were
seven American military members con-
victed of war crimes, but since then,

the Iraq war, Desert Storm, Kuwait,
and Afghanistan, we had over 200.
This is something that needs to be
looked at. We should not have our mili-
tary members risking conviction sim-
ply by trying to defend themselves and
those around them. So I am hoping
that we can come together in a bipar-
tisan way and make some changes,
some corrections, and some improve-
ments to military justice so that our
heroes don’t get killed trying to avoid
being seen as criminals by people who
don’t understand what they are going
through.
So, in any event, I am hopeful that
we will do something next week to help
fund border security, but it sounds like
from what we have heard on the floor
all we are going to do is help attract
more people to come in illegally be-
cause we are going to send $4 billion or
so down to the border.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE 2019 CON-
GRESS-BUNDESTAG/BUNDESRAT
EXCHANGE
HON. NANCY PELOSI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, June 21, 2019
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, since 1983,
the U.S. Congress House and Senate and the
German Bundestag and Bundesrat have con-
ducted an annual exchange program for staff
members from both countries. The program
gives professional staff the opportunity to ob-
serve and learn about each other’s political in-
stitutions and interact on issues of mutual in-
terest.
A staff delegation from the U.S. Congress
will be selected to visit Germany from Friday,
November 1 to Sunday, November 10, 2019.
During this exchange, the delegation will at-
tend meetings with Bundestag/Bundesrat party
staff members, and representatives of numer-
ous political, business, academic and media
agencies.
A comparable delegation of German staff
members will visit the United States from Sat-
urday, September 14 to Sunday, September
22, 2019. They will attend similar meetings in
Washington.
The Congress-Bundestag/Bundesrat Ex-
change is highly regarded in Germany and the
United States and is one of several exchange
programs sponsored by public and private in-
stitutions in the United States and Germany to
foster better understanding of the politics and
policies of both countries. This exchange is
funded by the U.S. Department of State’s Bu-
reau of Educational and Cultural Affairs.
The U.S. delegation should consist of expe-
rienced and accomplished Hill staff who can
contribute to the success of the exchange on
both sides of the Atlantic. The Bundestag re-
ciprocates by sending senior staff profes-
sionals to the United States.
Applicants should have a demonstrable in-
terest in events in Europe. Applicants need
not be working in the field of foreign affairs, al-
though such a background can be helpful. The
composite U.S. delegation should exhibit a
range of expertise in issues of mutual concern
to the United States and Germany such as,
but not limited to, trade, security, the environ-
ment, economic development, health care,
and other social policy issues. This year’s del-
egation should be familiar with transatlantic re-
lations within the context of recent world
events.
Please note that the U.S. participants are
expected to plan and implement the meetings
and programs for the Bundestag/Bundesrat
staff members when they visit the United
States.
Participants are selected by a bipartisan
committee.
Members of the House and Senate who
would like a member of their staff to apply for
participation in this year’s program should di-
rect them to submit a resume and cover letter
in which they state their qualifications, the
contributions they can make to a successful
program and some assurances of their ability

IN RECOGNITION OF AMERICAN
COASTER ENTHUSIASTS
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, June 21, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the American Coaster Enthusiasts
(ACE), a non-profit organization founded in
1978, that represents the interests of the most
ardent amusement ride enthusiasts. With more
than 5,500 members from over 16 countries,
ACE amasses a collective historical perspec-
tive making ACE the world’s largest club of its
kind.
It all started when four coaster lovers met at
a coaster-riding marathon in Virginia in 1977.
Today, ACE is an international volunteer run
organization that offers an online newspaper,
a quarterly magazine, and a National Roller
Coaster Museum and Archive.
ACE’s goal is to promote the conservation,
appreciation, and enjoyment of roller coasters
and their place in history as architectural and
engineering landmarks. ACE celebrates wood-
en roller coasters as an integral part of the
fabric that is Americana.
ACE has successfully saved and refur-
bished endangered coasters, including Leap-
the-Dips, the world’s oldest roller coaster lo-
cated at Lakemont Park in Altoona, Pennsyl-
vania and the 1925 Giant Dipper in San
Diego. Since 1985, the club has either directly
or indirectly helped to save more than half a
dozen classic coasters and presents awards in
recognition of significant roller coasters.
ACE holds many events including tours
throughout the world to celebrate extreme
coasters of all kinds and an annual Coaster
Convention.
At this year’s Coaster Convention Gala at
the Knott’s Berry Farm Resort Hotel on June
20th, the ACE ‘‘Landmark Coasters’’ Award
will honor Montezooma’s Revenge, the first
flywheel-launched roller coaster in the world.
Introduced May 21, 1978, Montezooma’s Re-
venge is the last roller coaster of its kind still
in operation in the United States.
Please join me in honoring the accomplish-
ments of the American Coaster Enthusiasts,
who certainly live up to their motto: ‘‘You join
ACE for the roller coasters; you stay for the
friendships.’’

Friday, June 21, 2019
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Kyla Johnston of Columbia
Falls and Karlee Albertson of Billings for their
entrepreneurial spirit that has contributed to
their communities. Kyla conducts a children’s
reading program, donates books, and encour-
ages kids to read. Karlee paints nails for char-
ity and has raised more than $20,000 for
Christmas gift-giving programs.
Kyla is a recent graduate of Columbia Falls
High School. As part of a monthly community
dinner program that brings together area fami-
lies, Kyla reads to the children and brings
them books to read at home. She is raising
funds to purchase new books and to expand
the program. Kyla’s strong sense of vol-
unteerism also leads her to shovel snow for
seniors and plant flowers at the Montana Vet-
erans Home in Columbia Falls.
Karlee recently completed sixth grade at
Castle Rock Elementary in Billings. She began
her ‘‘Nails for a Cause’’ program as a first-
grade student. By painting nails at school and
community events and through donations,
Karlee has raised more than $20,000 for char-
ity. Every year, she shops for Christmas pre-
sents and wraps them with the help of other
volunteers. Her efforts have reached over 250
less fortunate people in her community.
For their work in their communities, Kyla
and Karlee were recently recognized as Mon-
tana’s top youth volunteers by the National
Association of Secondary School Principals
and Prudential Financial, Inc.
Madam Speaker, for their entrepreneurial
spirit and dedication to serving their commu-

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E814 June 21, 2019
From President Trump’s decision to unilater-
ally withdraw from the Iran deal to alienating
our key allies and imposing crushing sanctions
on Iran, it’s clear that Trump Administration
has no interest in pursuing principled, diplo-
matic engagement to resolve our differences.
In addition, Secretary of State Pompeo once
again floated the idea of using the 2001
AUMF as the legal basis for the use of force
against Iran—allowing the Administration to
circumvent Congress.
This is a stark reminder of the dangers of
leaving the overly-broad 2001 AUMF on the
books.
That’s why I was proud that the House
passed a federal spending package this week
that included my language to sunset the 2001
AUMF after 8 months.
This sent a clear message to the Adminis-
tration that the 2001 AUMF cannot be used as
the legal authority to go to war and that it
MUST come to Congress to seek authority for
the use of force against Iran—as required by
the Constitution.
Congress must work to repeal the 2001
AUMF and ensure that the U.S. doesn’t barrel
into another disastrous war in the Middle East.

RECOGNIZING DR. GUY ‘‘ZAK’’
ZAKREVSKY
HON. ERIC SWALWELL
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, June 21, 2019
Mr. SWALWELL of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise to recognize Dr. Guy ‘‘Zak’’
Zakrevsky on the occasion of his retirement
after 34 years of service to education in the
East Bay, the last six of which he devoted to
the Hayward Unified School District (HUSD).
Zak joined HUSD in 2013 as the Director of
the Hayward Center for Education and Ca-
reers at the Hayward Adult School (HAS). He
took on this role with one goal in mind: ensur-
ing students have the education, literacy, and
job skills training required to reach their full
potential.
In pursuit of this goal, Zak set out to imple-
ment and bolster innovative and impactful pro-
grams that would work to improve student
achievement. Under his stewardship, pro-
grams such as Career Technical and Voca-
tional Education and Youth Re-engagement
for At-Risk Youth have flourished and provided
students with invaluable exposure and work-
place experience.
Zak understands that, if given the right re-
sources, each student has the potential to
excel. It is why he, alongside his team and in
partnership with other community organiza-
tions, helped create the Raising Leaders in
Hayward Workshops. These workshops lever-
aged access within the City of Hayward’s
Human Resources Department and set out to
inspire students with experiences from a
cross-section of industries while placed in paid
internships and developing the skills needed
to succeed in their desired careers.
Zak always strived to make HAS a hub for
our community. He worked closely with out-
side organizations, such as the Alameda
County Deputy Sheriff’s Activities League for
disadvantaged communities, to provide new
soccer fields, boxing coaches and tour-
naments, the construction of a new gym-
nasium, and a dance studio open to everyone.
It was through these collaborative efforts that
a new Makerspace became available for any-
one interested in fostering their creative en-
ergy or entrepreneurial spirit. In 2017 the
Makerspace graciously hosted my office’s suc-
cessful Congressional App Challenge at which
students could operate 3D printers and plas-
ma cutters during breaks from writing lines of
code. Zak knew that it took bringing everyone
together to make a positive impact in the lives
of our students.
I want to thank Dr. Guy Zakrevsky for the
contributions he has made to the 15th Con-
gressional District and his dedication to all our
students in the East Bay. His work will have
a lasting and profound impact on the shape of
our community, and I wish him a long and re-
laxing retirement.

HONORING DOROTHY ‘‘MOM’’
BROWN FOR HER DEDICATION TO
THE PHI KAPPA PSI HOUSE
HON. JAMES R. BAIRD
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, June 21, 2019
Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to
honor Dorothy ‘‘Mom’’ Brown for her dedica-
tion to the Phi Kappa Psi house at DePauw
University. Few individuals have had an im-
pact on Phi Kappa Psi as great as Dorothy,
and we thank her for her selflessness.
Prior to her time with Phi Kappa Psi, Doro-
thy graduated from Indiana University, receiv-
ing her Bachelor of Science in Education and
Master of Science in Administration and Su-
pervision, and began a teaching career in
Gary, Indiana. After serving as principal in
Warren Township Schools in Indianapolis in
the 1980’s, Dorothy returned to her home in
Greencastle in 1986 to teach in the education
department at DePauw University.
In 1993, Dorothy took on a new role as
Housemother of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity.
She quickly became an ‘‘anchor’’ of Phi Kappa
Psi and made it a memorable experience for
generations of young men over the next 26
years.
She was honored in 2009 for her contribu-
tions to DePauw by the city of Greencastle as
the DePauw Cultural Resource center was re-
named in her honor. Whether during her time
as an elementary school teacher or fraternity
Housemother, she exemplified leadership and
compassion. I am proud to call her a fellow
Hoosier.
On behalf of the 4th District of Indiana, I
thank her for her dedication to her community,
and I wish her the very best in retirement.

Friday, June 21, 2019
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker,
today I recognize Mr. Michael A. Nelson of the
United States Army Legislative Liaison office
for his extraordinary dedication to duty and
service to our Nation. Mr. Nelson will soon
transition from his current assignment as a
Department of the Army Civilian and Congres-
sional Operations Analyst with the Department
of the Army in the House of Representatives
to serve as the Congressional Travel Manager
for the Office of the Chief Legislative Liaison
at the Pentagon.
A native of Little Rock, Arkansas, Mike is a
former Navy Legislative Liaison and served 24
honorable years in the United States Navy. He
enlisted in the Navy and reported to Recruit
Training Command San Diego, California in
February 1993 and served on a myriad of sea
and shore duty assignments until his retire-
ment in February 2017.
In July 2017, Mike was selected to serve as
a Department of the Army Civilian and Con-
gressional Operations Analyst in the Army
House Liaison Office. In his role as an Ana-
lyst, Mike served as the primary liaison be-
tween Members of the 115th and 116th Con-
gresses, their Staff, Legislative Committees,
and the U.S. Army. Mike also provided factual,
coordinated, and timely replies to Congres-
sional Inquiries. Additionally, Mr. Nelson
planned, scheduled and coordinated Secretary
of the Army events and accompanied Con-
gressional and Staff Delegations on worldwide
fact-finding and investigative missions and
built the relationships needed to increase the
trust and confidence the U.S. Congress has in
the U.S. Army.
Madam Speaker, on behalf of a grateful na-
tion, it is my honor to recognize the selfless
service and sacrifice of a fellow Arkansan, Mi-
chael Anthony Nelson, as he proceeds to the
next chapter in his remarkable career. I wish
him the very best.

today, along with Congressman ED PERL-
MUTTER, Congressman DOUG LAMBORN, Con-
gressman SCOTT TIPTON, Congressman KEN
BUCK, Congressman JASON CROW, and Con-
gressman JOE NEGUSE, to honor the life of Pat
Bowlen, a beloved husband, father and long-
time owner of the Denver Broncos.
Pat is a household name for anyone who
watches football. For over three decades, Pat
made the city of Denver and the state of Colo-
rado proud by demanding excellence in his
team.
‘‘I want to be No. 1 in everything’’ Pat was
famously known for saying. And, having
brought home three Superbowl championships
for Colorado, it’s a motto he certainly lived by.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E815
June 21, 2019
During his tenure, the Broncos amassed
over 300 wins, one of the highest marks for
any one NFL team owner during the same
amount of time. But his legacy stretches far
beyond the field.
Pat and his family often gave back to the
community they loved. Pat was especially pas-
sionate about supporting the Boys and Girls
Club of America—and since 2003, his gen-
erosity helped improve the lives of more than
15,000 teens living in the Denver metro area
and around the state.
Madam Speaker, Pat Bowlen lived a re-
markable life and he will be missed. From
‘‘The Drive’’ to ‘‘Tebow-mania’’ to the Peyton
Manning comeback story, Pat’s impact on the
Broncos will likely go unrivaled by anyone
else.
In 1998, when the Broncos won their first
ever Superbowl, Pat turned to hoist the
Lombardi trophy and declared, ‘‘This one’s for
John.’’
It was a simple phrase, but his tribute to the
quarterback perfectly captured Pat’s devotion
to his team, and how he consistently lifted up
his players and his community.
So today, as members of Colorado’s Con-
gressional delegation, we wish to declare that
‘‘this one’s for Pat.’’
We join with millions of Broncos fans around
the country to thank him for the pride he
brought to the team, the city of Denver, and
our state.
We offer our deepest condolences to the
Bowlen family for their loss, and we hope that
they find comfort in knowing how many Colo-
radans are so appreciative for Pat and his
life’s work.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF
BELLA HIRIGOYEN
HON. TED LIEU
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, June 21, 2019
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam Speak-
er, Bella Hirigoyen was an immigrant who
lived the American dream. Born in Israel to
two Holocaust survivors, her family was spon-
sored by U.S. Steel. Her father, George
Weibel, was a part of the design and build
teams at Hughes Aircraft Company for the
Surveyor spacecraft which hung in the Smith-
sonian Air and Space Museum for decades.
Bella arrived in America at the age of five,
learned English, and became very successful
in school. She graduated from Fairfax High
School in the Los Angeles Unified School Dis-
trict.
Bella and her husband, Richard, worked
hard to be able to afford a home in the City
of Torrance where they lived together for thir-
ty-three of their almost forty years together.
She carved out a career in medical manage-
ment. Her love and respect for patients en-
deared them to her, and her colleagues main-
tained friendships with her long after their
work relationships ended.
Bella was a true example of love and devo-
tion. There was nothing more important to her
than family. She loved visiting the Central
California Coast with the love of her life, Rich-
ard, where they could visit wineries or watch
the California sunset. She was devoted to
helping her children with their pursuits whether
acting as a campaign manager for her son,
Jeremy Gerson, or assisting her daughter,
Stacey Stewart, start her own business. Bella
was always attending sporting and school
events for her grandchildren Lucas, Aurora,
William and Blake. She even held positions on
two different PTA executive boards at the
same time. Bella could not spend enough time
with family and especially appreciated that her
sister, Irene Weibel, would host regular family
BBQs so their 94-year-old mother, Martha
Weibel, could attend.
Bella passed on June 2, 2019, as she lived,
surrounded by her family.

RECOGNIZING REMARKS OF RABBI
DR. ISRAEL ZOBERMAN
HON. ELAINE G. LURIA
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, June 21, 2019
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
include in the RECORD a statement submitted
by Rabbi Dr. Israel Zoberman, founder and
spiritual leader of the new Temple Lev Tikvah
(Heart of Hope), a Reform Jewish congrega-
tion in Virginia Beach.
My heart indeed overflows with hope, grat-
itude and love as I humbly though proudly
announce the blessed birth of the youngest
synagogue in Virginia Beach and Hampton
Roads. It is housed in a unique ecumenical
Christian setting, the only such in the world,
making it now an even more exceptional
interfaith center. Church Of The Holy Apos-
tles, established in Virginia Beach in 1977, is
both an Episcopal and Catholic congrega-
tion. Their loving embrace of my new Re-
form Jewish Temple is ample and inspiring
testimony to their genuine ecumenical spirit
reaching beyond their own common and di-
verse Christian traditions. With this golden
opportunity we are making and impacting
history. Our one God is surely smiling upon
us.
They graciously invite their Jewish breth-
ren to tend to our four-thousand-year-old
nourishing roots that have blessed the
human family, instrumental in birthing the
two other great monotheistic world religions
of Christianity and Islam. Bishop James
Magness of the Episcopal Diocese of South-
ern Virginia and Bishop Barry Knestout of
the Roman Catholic Diocese of Richmond are
to be commended for their broad ecumenical
vision, spiritual fortitude and shining faith
in action. Together we reaffirm a holy bond
in face of a complex and trying history. We
are committed to overcome troubling past
shadows. Having already made major strides
forward, we should maintain and build upon
those breakthrough accomplishments of
monumental change.
We are mutually enabled to cultivate a
precious interfaith linkage, appreciating
each other’s differences and particularities
while celebrating our often overlooked but
no less important commonalities, as we col-
lectively admit to our shortcomings, igno-
rance and biases. This awesome journey of
mutual discovery while interfacing under
one roof, challenges us all to bring out the
best God planted within us. It gains added
critical significance against the unsettling
backdrop of the global resurgence of con-
suming dark forces. Anti-Semitism with its
recent deadly and shocking manifestation in
American synagogues, along with horrific
terrorist attacks on Christians, Muslims,
Sikhs and others at worship and elsewhere.
I am acutely mindful of my personal sacred
responsibility to ever be a builder of
Shalom’s essential bridges of healing, hope
and harmony. After all, I am a family mem-
ber of the Holocaust’s surviving remnant of
European Jewry.
Let us count our blessings even as we com-
mit to turning blemishes into blessings and
keep from turning blessings into blemishes.
We shall together yet repair our blemished
planet into a blessed and better home for all
of God’s children. The Divine delights in di-
versity, God’s divinity and human dignity
are one and inseparable.

OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, June 21, 2019
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker,
today I rise to honor and recognize Imam Mu-
hammad Siddeeq on his 83rd birthday.
Imam Siddeeq has long been a dedicated
advocate for social justice, engaging Muslim
communities in Indianapolis and across our
country in grassroots activism and policy ob-
jectives to bring about positive change.
Whether serving as the director of the Univer-
sity of Islam, the largest Islamic school in
America, or a teacher in our local schools and
universities, he has remained a driven and
principled individual who is deeply passionate
about preparing future leaders.
Imam Siddeeq is a man who speaks his
mind and is unafraid to spark difficult but nec-
essary conversations about issues affecting
our communities. I have been blessed to call
him a friend and mentor for many years, as
have many others throughout his life.
Imam Siddeeq is an educator, activist, pub-
lished author, and spiritual leader. He is also
a proud family man, with an equally resolute
wife, Sister Fareedah Siddeeq. Together, they
have been blessed with fifteen children and
many grandchildren.
Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in
wishing Imam Muhammad Siddeeq a happy
birthday. His work has informed and inspired
countless individuals in our community, and he
leaves a legacy of service to be followed for
all Americans.

faith. Since its first meeting on September 12,
2009, the Ecumenical Prayer Hour, now called
the Community Hour of Prayer Group, has
dramatically expanded to include over 20

Mother Gloria Edwards has had a significant

turing personality, she teaches and counsels
women in her congregation and the greater
Washtenaw community. We thank Mother Glo-

SUPPORT FOR H.R. 2740
HON. DORIS O. MATSUI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, June 21, 2019
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 2740, the minibus appropriations
bill, which includes funding for Energy and
Water Development. I applaud the Commit-
tee’s addition of funds for the programs of the
Army Corps of Engineers, especially for con-
tinuation of flood control work in my district,
which includes Sacramento and West Sac-
ramento. The bill contains funds for continu-
ation of construction of levees in the Natomas
Basin and for continuation of design of the
West Sacramento Project. Those initiatives
are essential steps in providing adequate pro-
tection for my constituents, who live in one of
the most flood-prone areas in the country.
I also strongly support the Committee’s in-
clusion of additional undesignated funds that
the Corps of Engineers will distribute through
a Work Plan to be developed after the bill is
signed into law. Furthermore, I appreciate the
Committee’s allowance for six undesignated
construction ‘‘New Starts,’’ which is critically
important to West Sacramento. As the bill
moves forward, I urge the continued inclusion
of robust funding for a Work Plan and of an
adequate number of New Starts for flood con-
trol to address these needs.
My district can benefit immensely from
these provisions. The Corps has recently indi-
cated that additional funds will be needed in
Fiscal Year 2020 for the Natomas Project due
to cost increases and weather delays. Addi-
tionally, it is my understanding that the West
Sacramento Project is making very good
progress and will soon be positioned for a
New Start and accompanying initial construc-
tion funding. With this in mind, I plan to con-
tinue working with the leadership of the Corps
of Engineers, the Sacramento Area Flood
Control Agency, and the West Sacramento
Area Flood control Agency to determine the
optimum funding and New Start designation
for my communities.
HONORING THE WORK OF WILLIAM
HENRY SIMONS, III, AND THE
WILLIAM HENRY SIMONS, III,
SCHOLARSHIP FUND
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, June 21, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to ask the House of Representatives to join
me in recognizing the work of William Henry
Simons, III, and the William Henry Simons, III,
Scholarship Fund.
On Saturday, June 22, the Washington
Teachers’ Union (WTU), which represents
educators in the District of Columbia’s public
schools, will re-name its scholarship fund the
William Henry Simons, III, Scholarship Fund in
honor of one of D.C.’s most important leaders,
William Henry Simons, III, who passed away
in 2016. This scholarship has been making
contributions to the District of Columbia since
1974. The Scholarship Fund is dedicated to
encouraging D.C.’s best and brightest stu-
dents to pursue careers in education and sup-
port the next generation of D.C. teachers. I am
particularly pleased and honored to offer this
resolution not only because of Simons’ much
deserved merit as a teacher and a union lead-
er but also because he was my history teach-
er when I attended Banneker High School
here in the District.
In 1972, WTU, under the leadership of Si-
mons, called a strike of D.C. Public School
teachers to protest pay and working condi-
tions. The strike violated D.C. law prohibiting
strikes by public employees, and a fine of
$50,000 was imposed on the union. Simons
asked the court to use the money to benefit
D.C. public school students. The request went
to the D.C. Superior Court, which in 1974,
granted Simons his request. That was the be-
ginning of the WTU Scholarship Fund Pro-
gram. Since 1974, the Fund has awarded
scholarships totaling more than $1,000,000 to
over 100 D.C. public school students.
Simons was born in D.C. in 1924 and at-
tended segregated D.C. public schools. In
1943, he interrupted his studies at Miner
Teachers College to serve in World War II. On
D-Day, June 6, 1944, as a sergeant major in
the 262nd Quartermasters Battalion, Simons
was one of the heroes who stormed Nor-
mandy and helped bring about the end of Nazi
oppression. He was awarded the Bronze Star
and the Croix de Guerre for his courage. After
the war, Simons completed his education and
began an 18-year career as a social studies
teacher at Banneker Junior High in D.C.
Simons was elected president of WTU in
1964 and served for a total of 25 years. Dur-
ing his tenure as president, Simons was a
champion of D.C. home rule and fought
against plans that would have de facto re-seg-
regated D.C. schools. He was also a pioneer
in fighting for educational equity and the right
of every D.C. public school student to receive
the educational opportunities they needed to
succeed, regardless of their race, ethnicity, im-
migration status or economic circumstances.
He was an observer at the first democratic
elections in South Africa, a college lecturer,
writer and consultant, and in 1995, he was ap-
pointed treasurer of the prestigious Associa-
tion for the Study of African American Life and
History, which was founded by the legendary
historian Carter G. Woodson.
Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in commending and
celebrating the life and legacy of William
Henry Simons, III, and in congratulating the
Washington Teachers’ Union for re-naming its
scholarship fund in his honor.

CELEBRATING THE CAREER OF
MARTIN TELLER AT THE FINGER
LAKES AREA COUNSELING AND
RECOVERY AGENCY
HON. TOM REED
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, June 21, 2019
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
celebrate the service of Martin Teller to the
Finger Lakes Area Counseling and Recovery
Agency and congratulate him on his retire-
ment.
For the last thirty-three years, Marty Teller
has served as the Executive Director of Finger
Lakes Area Counseling and Recovery Agency
(FLACRA). His dedicated service and wealth
of experience has ensured the highest of qual-
ity service, that FLACRA is known for, to peo-
ple struggling with substance abuse. FLACRA
offers a unique Continuum of Care for their cli-
ents, providing services such as addictions cri-
sis counseling, outpatient services, community
residences, supportive living, housing, and
care management.
In addition to his thirty-three years as the
Executive Director of FLACRA, Marty had pre-
viously worked for fifteen years in chemical
dependency agency management. His exten-
sive experience in aiding those struggling with
substance abuse has made him a leader on
the issue in the community and statewide.
Matty serves on the Boards of the New York
Association of Alcohol and Substance Abuse
Providers, Common Ground Health, and the
Finger Lakes Performing Provider System. He
has also served in leadership roles in the Fin-
ger Lakes Housing Consortium, the Region II
Consortium of Alcohol and Substance Abuse
Services, and Recovery Net.
As Matty moves forward with the next chap-
ter of his life, we applaud his tireless efforts to
help those struggling with substance abuse in
our communities and we wish him all the best
in his retirement.
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to
celebrate Marty Teller and his extraordinary
career.

HONORING THE LIFE OF SUE
FENLEY MEYERS
HON. BRIAN BABIN
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, June 21, 2019
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the life of long-time Deer Park resident,
Sue Fenley Meyers, who passed away on
April 10, 2019 in Colorado.
Sue Fenley Meyers was born on May 10,
1938 in Lufkin, Texas. She had six brothers
and six sisters, two children, three grand-
children, and 21 nieces and nephews, all of
whom she loved dearly. Sue studied drama at
the University of Southwestern Louisiana in
Lafayette and went on to act in, direct, write,
promote, and produce over 200 theatrical
events in her lifetime.
The city officials in Deer Park, Texas have
long recognized the community’s love of theat-
rical arts. On May 4, 1981, the City hired Sue
as the full-time Artistic Managing Director of
‘‘The Art Park Players.’’ Under her leadership
the program experienced rapid growth and in
December 1986 the City opened its current
theater facility. Sue’s legacy is synonymous
with the history of The Art Park Players. Sev-
eral of her students have gone on to become
professional writers, directors, actors, dancers,
singers and influential artists to this day.
The thing she loved the most in the world
were children. Sue established the Mead-Holm
Scholarship in 1990, which was awarded an-
nually to outstanding Junior Art Park Players
students, and the first annual Sue Fenley
Meyers Scholarships (six in total) were pre-
sented last month in her memory. Sue’s 22-
plus years within our community reflect a life-
time of achievement through her love for chil-
dren, passion, vision and the importance of
arts and arts education in Deer Park.
She retired from the City of Deer Park in
2004 and moved to Colorado, where she is
survived by her beloved son Jay Meyers and
wife Margaret, daughter Kelley Meyers-South-
ern and husband Brent, grandchildren
Susannah Roberts, Mitchell Meyers, and
Johnny Meyers, and her four sisters and three
brothers.
Madam Speaker, my condolences remain
with the family, theatre family, and friends of
Sue Fenley Meyers.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DR.
BERNICE ‘‘BUNNY’’ SANDLER
HON. BRENDA L. LAWRENCE
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, June 21, 2019
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the remarkable life of Doctor
Bernice ‘‘Bunny’’ Sandler, on the 47th anniver-
sary of Title IX. Dr. Sandler was an activist
and champion of women’s equality in higher
education, which earned her the nickname
‘‘Godmother of Title IX.’’ She passed away in
January of this year at the age of ninety.
After being passed over for a job in 1969 at
the University of Maryland, Dr. Sandler real-
ized that she must act on the discrimination
she experienced. During this time in history,
academic departments refused to hire women
in non-entry level positions and many grad-
uate programs denied admission to women,
but Sandler refused to take no for an answer.
She researched the strategies of black civil
rights activists and applied them to women’s
rights in academia.
After discovering a presidential executive
order barring federal contractors from discrimi-
nating based on race, color, religion, and na-
tional origin, Sandler contacted the U.S. De-
partment of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract
Compliance, where she planned the first com-
plaint against universities and colleges on dis-
crimination.
Sandler helped the Women’s Equity Action
League start a national campaign to file com-
plaints against widespread sex discrimination
at universities. She formed alliances with
Members of Congress, including Representa-
tive Martha Griffiths of my home state of
Michigan, who gave the first speech in Con-
gress about discrimination against women in
education.
Sandler went on to become a Congressional
staffer, leading the hearings on women’s edu-
cation and employment which led to Title IX of
the Educational Amendments of 1972. After
the passage of Title IX Sandler continued her
fight for gender equity, delivering thousands of
speeches and providing consultation for
schools who sought to integrate women.
As we celebrate the 47th anniversary of
Title IX, we must celebrate Doctor Bernice
‘‘Bunny’’ Sandler for all the hard work she put
into making it possible.

COMMEMORATING THE FIFTIETH
ANNIVERSARY OF THE HAPPI-

HON. TOM REED
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, June 21, 2019
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to
commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the
Happiness House in Geneva, New York.
Fifty years ago, a collection of parents of
children with Cerebral Palsy united to found
Happiness House in Geneva, NY. Using funds
raised by the New York State Elks Club and
the Women’s Club of Geneva, Happiness
House opened their first childcare program,
serving five children with disabilities. From
these humble beginnings, Happiness House
has grown throughout the years to provide a
comprehensive array of programs and serv-
ices to more than 1,150 children, adults and
their families in Ontario, Seneca, Wayne, and
Yates Counties.
We care about ensuring people have a fair
chance to reach their full potential and Happi-
ness House gives folks this exact opportunity.
The vision of Happiness House is that every
community be ready to welcome and utilize
the talents and abilities of all individuals. Every
day they work to make that vision a reality by
providing the highest quality, innovative and
cost-effective services to children and adults
with and without disabilities. Happiness House
cooperates with families and partners through-
out the Finger Lakes community to achieve
this goal.
Fifty years of serving the community is cer-
tainly a cause for celebration. I congratulate
the Happiness House on this impressive mile-
stone and look forward to their continued suc-
cess in the years to come.
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to
commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the
Happiness House.

Administration to prioritize funding for the
modernization of medical transportation pro-
grams for rural, underserved and female Vet-
erans.
According to the American Hospital Associa-
tion, 3.6 million people in the U.S. do not ob-
tain medical care due to transportation bar-
riers. And another report tells us that missed
healthcare appointments cost the U.S. health
system $150 billion each year.
The underlying committee report includes a
pilot program to address transportation bar-
riers for rural Veterans.
In light of this and the Veterans Transpor-
tation Program, the VA can play a critical role
in collaborating with other federal agencies to
reduce duplication and modernize medical
transportation programs across public pro-
grams.
As we work to address rising health care
costs, our federal agencies collaborate to
modernize and expand public medical trans-
portation programs.
CONDEMNING FEBRUARY 14 TER-
RORIST ATTACKS AND AC-
KNOWLEDGING THE PLIGHT OF
THE KASHMIRI PANDITS
HON. BRAD SHERMAN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, June 21, 2019
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, as Chair-
man of the House Foreign Affairs Sub-
committee on Asia, I want to draw attention to
the ongoing problem of terrorism in Kashmir
and the often-overlooked plight of the Kashmiri
Hindu Pandits.
On February 14, 2019, a terrorist attack in
Kashmir killed 40 Indian Central Reserve Po-
lice Force personnel. This attack was per-
petrated by an operative of Jaish-e-Moham-
med, a U.S. and UN-designated terrorist
group. Then, on June 13, 2019, 5 Indian Cen-
tral Reserve Police Force personnel were
killed in another terrorist attack in Kashmir
perpetrated by Al Umar Mujahideen, a dif-
ferent terrorist organization. These attacks are
hardly unusual—over the years, thousands of
civilians and security personnel have been
killed in terrorist attacks in Kashmir.
The United States has been attacked by ter-
rorist groups similar to the ones in Kashmir. It
is therefore imperative that we stand with India
in this time of need.
The Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir has
historically had a culture of religious tolerance
and pluralism, where Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs,
Buddhists, and Christians practiced their faith
freely in an atmosphere of mutual respect and
peace. The violence the region has witnessed
in recent decades has eroded this tradition.
One group that has suffered as a result is the
Kashmiri Pandits, who have lived in Kashmir
for centuries. By some estimates, 300,000
Pandits once lived in Kashmir. Today, by
some estimates, only 3,000–5,000 remain.
This is a tragedy that is too often ignored.
Sadly, the violence in Kashmir is likely to con-
tinue until different sects restore the tradition
of religious tolerance and pluralism.
To conclude, I ask my colleagues to co-
sponsor H. Res. 408, which Congressman
PERRY, Congressman KRISHNAMOORTHI, and I
introduced in May 2019. Besides condemning
the February terrorist attacks, this resolution
acknowledges that the House of Representa-
tives supports the rights of religious and other
minorities around the world, including the
Kashmiri Pandits.
