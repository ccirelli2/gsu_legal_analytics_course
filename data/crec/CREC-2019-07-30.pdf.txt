Vol. 165 WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, JULY 30, 2019 No. 129
Senate
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was
called to order by the President pro
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY).
f
PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
Eternal God, who provides us with
strength for life’s journey, today, em-
power our Senators with an extraor-
dinary measure of grace to accomplish
Your purposes. As they work under the
duress of time and pressures from di-
verse interests, inspire them to strive
to live with integrity, making ethical
decisions that honor You.
Lord, be with their staff members
who run the offices and provide the
data needed for responsible decisions.
Be also with those who process the
mountains of business in and out of
cloakrooms. Lord, sustain those who
transcribe the debates for the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD. Bless those who mon-
itor parliamentary order, schedules,
and voting records. Protect those who
provide security at the doors, on the
floors, and on the streets. And, Lord,
bless our pages. Strengthen all who are
a part of the Senate’s support system,
surrounding them with Your protec-
tion and favor.
We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.
f
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The President pro tempore led the
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent to address the
Senate for 1 minute in morning busi-
ness.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
NATIONAL WHISTLEBLOWER
APPRECIATION DAY
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I
want to take our Nation and my col-
leagues back to the Revolutionary
War.
More than 240 years ago, sailors
aboard the warship Warren disclosed
significant misconduct by the com-
mander of the Continental Navy. The
Congress then recognized these brave
whistleblowers’ valuable contribution
to our brandnew Republic because, on
this day—today—in 1778, Congress
passed this resolution, saying: ‘‘It is
the duty of all persons in the service of
the United States . . . to give the ear-
liest information to Congress or other
proper authority of any misconduct,
frauds, or misdemeanors committed by
any offices or persons in the service of
these states.’’
That is the beginning of the govern-
ment recognizing whistleblowers as
valuable patriots.
Following in their footsteps, this
Senate has also unanimously agreed to
designate today as National Whistle-
blower Appreciation Day.
I yield the floor.
f
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY
LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.
f
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
the Senate has a lot of important busi-
ness to attend to before we adjourn for
the August State work period.
As a reminder to all of our col-
leagues, here is our considerable to-do
list for this week: Later this morning,
we will vote to confirm two more of
President Trump’s impressive nomi-
nees for district courts: Michael
Liburdi for the District of Arizona and
Peter Welte for the District of North
Dakota.
They are just the first two in a sig-
nificant group of judges—19 in all—that
the Senate needs to process before we
wrap up the week. We can’t head home
without making another big dent in
the backlog of qualified district judge
nominees whom partisan obstruction
has already kept waiting entirely too
long.
In addition, the Senate is not going
anywhere until we confirm two impres-
sive nominees to executive branch po-
sitions that play a vital role in U.S.
foreign policy and national security.
Ambassador Kelly Craft is President
Trump’s excellent choice to serve as
our Ambassador to the United Nations.
David Norquist is his pick for Deputy
Secretary of Defense.
Needless to say, these are troubling
times in a troubled world. We need to
get both of these highly capable public
servants on the job this week.
Finally, we must also pass the bipar-
tisan government funding agreement
that President Trump’s negotiating
team worked out with Speaker PELOSI.
Given the realities of divided govern-
ment, it is a strong deal that achieves
my Republican colleagues’ and my No.
1 priority: continuing to invest seri-
ously in rebuilding the readiness of our
Armed Forces and modernizing them to
meet the challenges of today.
The Trump administration has nego-
tiated their way to a major win on de-
fense. The House has passed the com-
promise legislation. The President is
ready and waiting to sign it.
Once the Senate passes it later this
week, he can sign it into law, taking
funding crises and long-term con-
tinuing resolutions off the table, and
pave Congress’s path toward a regular
appropriations process that will pro-
vide the resources our military com-
manders and our servicemembers need
to keep us safe.
I urge all of my colleagues to join
President Trump in support of this leg-
islation when we vote on it later this
week.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5152 July 30, 2019
TRIBUTE TO KATHRYN WEEDEN
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
on one final matter, as Senate major-
ity leader, it is my honor this morning
to acknowledge a truly remarkable leg-
acy of service to the Senate and really
to the Nation.
Next month, the Senate Page School
will say goodbye to its beloved prin-
cipal. After 26 years heading up this
unique institution, our very own Mrs.
Kathryn Weeden is starting a new
chapter as a very deserving retiree.
For more than a quarter century,
Principal Weeden has been a constant
anchor in a place where rotation and
change are par for the course.
The Page School, as we know, wel-
comes a new class of high-achieving
young people from all across the coun-
try every semester. These students’ ex-
perience is most famous for the fast-
paced, hands-on exposure to the inner
workings of American government it
involves, but in the early mornings and
late evenings, when they are not deliv-
ering bill text around the Capitol, as-
sisting Members on the floor, or en-
gaged in any number of tasks that help
this place actually run, they are also
dealing with the academic rigors of the
11th grade.
There are 30 teenagers at a time liv-
ing, studying, and working full time on
Capitol Hill. Needless to say, keeping
this unique arrangement running
smoothly is less than an ordinary job—
even a full-time one—and more like a
life’s mission. By all accounts, it is a
mission Principal Weeden has executed
with constant competence, total pro-
fessionalism, and the utmost grace.
Now, if I had to guess, a large share
of that grace was spent in 5 a.m. meet-
ings most mornings. That is typically
when she would first encounter what I
am sure were the most chipper and
alert 16- and 17-year-olds around. While
the hundreds of pages who have
worked, studied, and grown under Prin-
cipal Weeden’s watch may not miss
their early morning math class, they
sure will miss her. They are left with
lasting memories of her attentive
mentorship and compassion.
Among recent graduates of the Page
Program, some of whom I have been
proud to sponsor through my own of-
fice, the conclusion is clear: Principal
Weeden is simply the best.
They remember the way she would
make time for weekly one-on-one
meetings to check up on their progress
and talk about their future goals. They
remember the way she radiated excite-
ment leading the school in assembling
care packages for servicemembers de-
ployed overseas. They remember her
knack for reassuring words and for
helping them put the daily stresses of
high school in perspective.
Inevitably, after 26 years, Principal
Weeden’s legacy is counted in the flood
of letters sharing stories like these fol-
lowing the news of her retirement, but
it is also measured in her commitment
to transform the Page School as a top-
notch academic institution.
It is thanks to her no-nonsense lead-
ership that this unique program has
earned and maintained accreditation,
that its rigors have earned the atten-
tion and respect of prestigious univer-
sities, and that it continues to attract
talented and passionate educators to
carry on in her example.
Unsurprisingly, the colleagues and
faculty whom Ms. Weeden has
mentored and supervised are no less en-
thusiastic in their praise than her
former students. Talking to them
about their departing boss, you hear
words like disciplined, nurturing, and
patriotic. You are painted a picture
that looks something like a Mother Su-
perior, a no-nonsense administrator, an
exacting leader, and a true friend all in
one.
Being entrusted with the care, feed-
ing, education, and maturation of so
many young men and women over so
many years would be an accomplish-
ment no matter where Principal
Weeden had worked, but to do all that
at the Senate Page School means
something even more. To a special de-
gree, her legacy will have helped,
formed, and shaped America’s civic fu-
ture for the better.
Because she gave of herself so gener-
ously to a special class of young peo-
ple—those who are so interested in our
American Government that they just
had to come see it firsthand—today,
the Senate celebrates this outstanding
legacy and warmly congratulates Prin-
cipal Weeden on such a tremendous ac-
complishment. We thank her for all she
has done, and we wish her nothing but
happiness in the years that lie ahead.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
f
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY
LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader is recognized.
f
BUDGET AGREEMENT
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
the Senate has just a few more days
this week to pass legislation to lift the
budget caps and extend the debt ceiling
before the summer State work period.
As the minority leader, I don’t have
control over the schedule here on the
floor, much to my dismay. So I am left
to ask my friend, the majority leader,
who does control the floor schedule:
Why don’t we vote on the caps deal
today?
Four congressional leaders and the
White House reached an agreement 2
weeks ago. The President supports it.
The House has already passed it. Sec-
retary Mnuchin has said we need this
legislation urgently before the State
work period because he can’t guarantee
that we will not hit the debt ceiling be-
fore Congress reconvenes. The majority
leader spoke about the importance of
moving the budget agreement back in
mid-May. Now the clock is ticking.
I make clear to the leader and to all
of my friends on the other side of the
aisle, as well as all Americans: Demo-
crats are ready to vote on the House
bill today so it can get to the Presi-
dent’s desk and we can avoid even a
glimmer of default.
f
ELECTION SECURITY
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on
another matter, last week former Spe-
cial Counsel Mueller testified that Rus-
sian interference in our democracy
‘‘wasn’t a single attempt. They’re
doing it as we sit here and they expect
to do it in the next campaign.’’
The Russians, he said, interfered in
the last election and are trying to
interfere again. Mueller said: ‘‘Much
more needs to be done in order to pro-
tect against these intrusions, not just
by the Russians but by others as well.’’
It was not just Mueller who said
these things or agreed with these ideas
and sentiments. FBI Director Wray, ap-
pointed by President Trump, has
shared similar sentiments. Departing
DNI Director Coats—lifelong Repub-
lican, former member of this body, well
respected by all, and appointed by
President Trump—has repeatedly
warned about the threat posed by Rus-
sia. The Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee, chaired by a Republican, Sen-
ator BURR, did the same.
It is with these facts as the back-
drop—the testimony of prominent Re-
publicans, allies of President Trump
and friends and allies of our colleagues
here—that Democrats have been push-
ing for election security—so far, to lit-
tle avail. Leader MCCONNELL and the
Republican majority have not allowed
a single election security bill to reach
the floor of the Senate. We haven’t had
a single bill open for amendment all
year.
So, last week, understandably frus-
trated at the lack of progress, Demo-
crats asked unanimous consent to pass
House legislation to safeguard our elec-
tions. Leader MCCONNELL blocked that
request saying yesterday: ‘‘I am not
going to let Democrats and their
water-carriers in the media use Rus-
sia’s attack on our democracy as a Tro-
jan horse for partisan wish list items.’’
‘‘Partisan wish list items’’—really?
What are these items on our partisan
wish list, you might ask? Using paper
ballots—that is partisan? Using paper
ballots is widely agreed upon as a re-
form to protect our elections from ma-
nipulation. Does Leader MCCONNELL
object to paper ballots? Does Leader
MCCONNELL believe paper ballots are
partisan? They are part of our elec-
tions, whoever wins.
How about this one: We want the
postelection audits to make sure the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5153
July 30, 2019
Russians or any other foreign power
didn’t interfere. Does Leader MCCON-
NELL object to auditing our elections
to make sure the outcomes are accu-
rate? Are election audits partisan?
Making sure the States and localities
have adequate resources to update and
maintain election infrastructure—does
Leader MCCONNELL oppose that, when
21 attorneys general have said they
don’t have enough money now to guard
their election processes and machines
from manipulation by Russia or oth-
ers?
So that is ‘‘our partisan wish list’’—
paper ballots, election audits, and
money to protect us from the Russians.
If Leader MCCONNELL opposes these
policies, fine, but let him say so. I re-
peat, protecting our election from Rus-
sian interference is not a Democratic
issue or a Republican issue or an Inde-
pendent issue, and it is not a liberal
issue or a conservative issue. It is not
a moderate issue. It is an issue that
goes to the wellspring of our democ-
racy and something the Founding Fa-
thers warned about—foreign inter-
ference. James Madison, Thomas Jef-
ferson, George Washington, and Ben-
jamin Franklin all were worried about
foreign interference in our elections,
and now Leader MCCONNELL calls it
partisan to worry about it? Please.
If Leader MCCONNELL wants to debate
other legislation than what we propose
and what has passed the House—legis-
lation like the FIRE Act or the Duty to
Report Act or the Prevention of For-
eign Interference with Elections Act—
bring it on. Let’s do it. If Leader
MCCONNELL wants to address election
security in the appropriations process,
we would welcome his support on an
amendment to send more funding to
the States. We want to get something
done on election security because this
is not about party. This is a matter of
national security. This is about the
sanctity of elections, something for
which Americans have died for genera-
tions. It is not partisan at all. It is the
wellspring of our democracy.
But so long as the Senate Repub-
licans prevent legislation from reach-
ing the floor, so long as they oppose ad-
ditional appropriations to the States,
so long as they malign election secu-
rity provisions as ‘‘partisan wish
lists,’’ the critics are right to say that
Leader MCCONNELL and Republican
Senators are blocking election security
because, at the moment, that is true.
f
VENEZUELA
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on
one last subject, after I conclude my
remarks, I will yield to my friend, col-
league, and former roommate from Illi-
nois, who will ask this body to take up
and pass what I believe is a very impor-
tant measure, temporary protected sta-
tus for Venezuelans currently residing
in the United States.
Last week, the House passed bipar-
tisan legislation that would grant
these protections—a lifeline to families
who are facing a forced return to un-
stable and dangerous situations in
their country.
Few nations, outside wartime, have
endured the economic, humanitarian,
and political devastation that Ven-
ezuela endures today. Hospitals and
pharmacies lack basic medicines. The
rate of violent crime has risen sharply,
and 300,000 children are at risk of dying
from malnutrition. Venezuela clearly
meets the standard for temporary pro-
tected status. The situation is too dire
and too dangerous for Venezuelan na-
tionals to return to the country.
So I am glad the House has taken ac-
tion to pass these temporary protec-
tions on a bipartisan basis, and the
Senate should follow suit. The Presi-
dent could have acted on his own to
help Venezuelans living in America,
but he has repeatedly denied congres-
sional requests to extend TPS relief for
them during this critical time of tran-
sition from the despotic regime of
Nicolas Maduro. President Trump’s in-
action has compelled Congress to act.
So I salute my friend, Senator DUR-
BIN, as well as Senator MENENDEZ, our
two leaders on this issue, as they ask
the Senate to take up the House-passed
TPS bill. I hope, earnestly, that our
friends on the other side will let it go
through.
I suggest the absence of a quorum for
a moment so I might confer with the
Senator from Illinois.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

VENEZUELA
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I
want to thank the leader, Senator
SCHUMER from New York, for his intro-
duction of the remarks I am about to
make. But before I do, let me preface it
by saying that I couldn’t agree with
him more. When you take a look at
this empty Senate Chamber and realize
we are in session this week with the
possibility of bringing important legis-
lation to the floor, you have to ask the
obvious question: Where is everybody?
Why aren’t we acting like a Senate?
Why are we meeting and having
speeches instead of debate on impor-
tant legislation? What could be more
important than the security of an elec-
tion?
We have a lot of young people across
America. We say to them: Register to
vote. Your vote makes a difference.
You get to choose the leaders for this
country’s future. Be sure and vote.
But we have to be honest with you.
Your vote is under attack—first, by ap-
athy—people don’t register and they
don’t vote—and second, by outside for-
eign influence and forces.
We know what happened 4 years ago
in the Presidential election. The Rus-
sians tried to invade the U.S. electoral
process and change it. I know it first-
hand because it happened first in the
State of Illinois. Turns out someone
put together a computer program that
had a little opening in it, a little hole,
and that is all they needed. Sitting in
Moscow, these folks in front of com-
puters were searching day in and day
out for ways to get into the voters’ list
in Illinois, and they were successful.
They were successful in invading the
voting list, the official records of our
State on the people who were eligible
to vote. They could have done some
mischievous things. They could have
disrupted our election. Thank goodness
they didn’t, but it would have been as
simple as going through and just
changing the addresses, one digit in the
address of every registered voter, so
when that voter came to vote, the ID
card or information given to the judge
at the election place wouldn’t match
up in terms of their address with the
official record. That meant they would
have voted with a provisional ballot,
and those ballots would have stacked
up with the thousands of people who
could have been victimized by the Rus-
sians in my State of Illinois.
We said very publicly—we were the
first State to say publicly: The Rus-
sians have done this to us.
We didn’t see any changes in the
voter file. We knew they had the capac-
ity and ability to do it, but they didn’t.
We have known ever since that they
have been attacking our electoral proc-
ess.
Why didn’t we hear about it as much
in the most recent election in 2018?
Well, specifically because we were in
the circumstance where we were fight-
ing it. Our intelligence agencies were
fighting it.
So this is a valid issue, an important
issue, and it is one that I hope Leader

S5154 July 30, 2019
SCHUMER made clear to those listening
to this debate. Why won’t Senator
MITCH MCCONNELL bring to the floor of
the U.S. Senate election security legis-
lation—bipartisan legislation—that
will, in the course of passing it, make
us safer when it comes to our electoral
process? What is this kind of bromance
between the President and Vladimir
Putin? I don’t understand.
But now there appears to be another
party on the scene. Senator MCCON-
NELL is joining in this effort: Keep our
hands off of Russia. Don’t confront
Russia. I don’t understand why the
Senator from Kentucky is taking that
position. He should be pushing forward
on a bipartisan basis to protect our
election security.
Madam President, now I see my
friend and Republican colleague from
Utah is here, and I know the purpose of
his attendance. I am about to make a
statement about TPS status for Ven-
ezuelans in the United States. I will
preface it briefly, make my request,
and allow the Senator from Utah, if he
doesn’t want to stay here, to respond,
and I will continue.
Last year, I went to Venezuela. It
was my first time. I met with Presi-
dent Nicolas Maduro, and I said to him:
If you have the election you plan to
have, it will not be credible, and
around the world, you will find the
United States and many other nations
will reject the outcome. You have to
open up the process. Stop putting your
political opponents in jail. Have a real
election, a free election. Venezuela
needs it, not just from a constitutional
viewpoint, but your economy is in
shambles, and if you want the world to
join you in rebuilding the Venezuelan
economy, you have to be the credible
leader and you can’t be if you go
through with this election as planned.
That was my speech. It didn’t work.
He had the election as he planned it.
He made sure that his opponents were
under house arrest or in jail. He fixed
the vote and ended up declaring him-
self the winner, and no one accepted it.
So across the world, you find this re-
sistance to his leadership.
There are some 70,000 people from
Venezuela in the United States. They
are here on visitor visas, work visas,
student visas, and similar capacities.
They are now being asked to return to
Venezuela. But listen to the cir-
cumstances: In Venezuela—we know
that it is not safe for Americans to
visit. Senator MENENDEZ has spoken on
this issue. He is joining me in this ef-
fort today. We are warning Americans
that it is unsafe to visit Venezuela, but
we are telling the Venezuelans who are
in the United States that they have to
go back.
What we are asking for is temporary
protected status for these Venezuelans
to be able to stay in the United States
during the pendency of this contest
that is going on about the future of
that nation.
People are literally starving to death
in Venezuela. They have no medicine.
It is in the worst possible situation.
How can we in good conscience say to
these Venezuelans who are in the
United States that they have to re-
turn?
So the purpose of my effort today on
the floor is to say that we should dis-
charge from the Judiciary Committee
legislation that allows these Ven-
ezuelans to stay here while we have de-
clared it so dangerous in their home
country. It is a rational and thoughtful
thing to do, although, sadly, the
Trump administration has sent me a
letter saying they don’t approve of it.
It is time for Congress to act. It is
time for the Senate to act. I am going
to make my formal motion at this
point because Senator LEE has come to
the floor.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 549
Madam President, as if in legislative
session, I ask unanimous consent that
the Judiciary Committee be discharged
from further consideration of H.R. 549
and the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration; further, that the
bill be read a third time and passed and
the motion to reconsider be considered
made and laid upon the table with no
intervening action or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator from Utah.
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I reserve
the right to object after raising a cou-
ple of observations.
It is important to know that this bill
was passed by the House of Representa-
tives Thursday night. We just received
the paperwork from the House of Rep-
resentatives yesterday. This is a bill
that did not pass unanimously in the
House of Representatives—far from it.
There were at least 158 Republicans
who voted against it.
There are a number of my colleagues
in the Senate who, like me, would like
to see this and many other bills consid-
ered but would also like the oppor-
tunity to adequately review the legis-
lation as passed and to propose amend-
ments and have those amendments
voted on. So passing this bill right now
without that opportunity to review it,
to propose amendments and have those
considered, and just passing this unani-
mously is not the way we ought to be
passing this legislation.
I am happy to work with my distin-
guished colleague and my revered
friend from Illinois in moving in that
direction, but we are not ready to pass
this by unanimous consent right now.
We have amendments to propose. So on
that basis, I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I
want to thank my colleague from
Utah. I am sorry he objected to my re-
quest.
Why are we moving so quickly on
this? Because it is a matter of life and
death, that is why. Why did we decide
that this is of such an emergency na-
ture that the House has moved on this
already? Because, literally, people who
are forced to return to Venezuela may
face death. That is why we are moving
on this as quickly as we are.
I want to thank the House of Rep-
resentatives for passing this measure.
It is time for the Senate to act, and we
certainly have the time on the floor to
achieve that.
As I mentioned, if you go to Ven-
ezuela, as I did last year, you can see
literally on the streets the impact of
this disintegration of their economy
and the problems they are facing.
I visited Children’s Hospital in Cara-
cas, and it was heartbreaking for the
medical staff to sit down at the table
and tell me they didn’t have the basic
medicines we find in our medicine
chests at home or in the clinics of
America when it came to treating
these children. They did not have anti-
biotics. They didn’t have cancer drugs.
The economy in Venezuela is disinte-
grating before our eyes, and these peo-
ple—Venezuelans in the United States,
students and others—are saying they
would like to remain in the United
States and stay here until it is more
stable in their country. Historically,
there were no questions asked, and we
did that. We have done it over and over
again. But under this administration,
whenever the word ‘‘immigrant’’ comes
into the conversation, they freeze.
The same Trump administration has
told us that the Maduro regime is un-
acceptable and that we have to get rid
of it because of the terrible things that
are happening, that the people of Ven-
ezuela should have a free election to
decide their leader. This same adminis-
tration will not help the Venezuelans
who say they are fearful of heading
home to a country that is so dan-
gerous.
Let me read what this administra-
tion, which refuses to give temporary
protected status, says to people from
the United States who may want to
visit Venezuela. To me, it tells the
whole story. Here is what the Trump
State Department says about Ven-
ezuela today in the following travel ad-
visory to American citizens:
Do not travel to Venezuela due to crime,
civil unrest, poor health infrastructure, and
arbitrary arrest and detention of U.S. citi-
zens. . . . Violent crime, such as homicide,
armed robbery, kidnapping, and carjacking,
is common. . . . There are shortages of food,
electricity, water, medicine, and medical
supplies throughout much of Venezuela.
Those are the words of the Trump ad-
ministration about this country of
Venezuela, and when I ask that those
who are Venezuelan who are in our
country not be forced to return to
those conditions, there is an objection
not only from my friend the Repub-
lican Senator from Utah but also from
the Trump administration.
Now, make no mistake, if temporary
protected status is granted, that does
not mean we won’t ask any questions
of the Venezuelans here. They will
have to go through a criminal back-
ground check. If they are a dangerous
person, they are gone, period. No ques-
tions. They are gone. And that is the

way it should be. But for those, for ex-
ample, in my State who are university
students, who have their student visas
coming to an end—they are asking me:
Senator DURBIN, will you allow me to
stay in the United States until it is
safe in my country?
Is that an unreasonable request? If it
were Americans in similar plights in
places around the world, wouldn’t we
say: Give them a break. Give them a
chance to stay in a safe place.
I will close. I want to defer to my
friend from New Jersey, Senator
MENENDEZ, on this issue.
When I went to Venezuela last year,
in Caracas, I had a meeting. It was a
dinner meeting, and it was an unusual
one because it was with six members of
the General Assembly who are oppo-
nents of President Maduro, who is cur-
rently their leader in that country.
These opposition leaders opposed him,
and their lives were at stake because of
it.
We had dinner in a restaurant. It was
an unusual dinner. It was upstairs in a
back room, and the door was closed so
that no one could see us. There were
six of them, and they said to me: If you
come back next year, Senator, two of
us will have been deported, two of us
will be in prison; and two of us will
have disappeared.
That is what happens to the opposi-
tion in Venezuela if you happen to op-
pose President Maduro. It is that dan-
gerous.
One of those six was a man named
Juan Guaido. I met him that night for
the first time. Little did I know that
he would step up several months ago
and put his life and his family’s lives
on the line to say: I think Venezuela
needs new leadership. Exceptional
courage on his part. I met him then. I
have met his wife since. They are lit-
erally risking their lives for their
country. They understand how dan-
gerous it is.
All I asked for today on the floor is
for those Venezuelans who wish to stay
here in safety until this political sce-
nario plays out, that they be allowed
to stay here. That is all I was asking
for—temporary protected status. I am
sorry that Senator LEE objected. He
did note, though, that in some period
of time—I hope very soon—he will re-
consider that position and give us a
chance to provide safety for the Ven-
ezuelans who are visiting here in the
United States.
Because he is here and has been such
a great ally of mine in this effort, I
would like to yield the floor to my
friend from New Jersey, Senator
MENENDEZ.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey.
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President,
let me thank my colleague from Illi-
nois, who has been a clarion voice in
this regard, a strong proponent of
human rights and democracy in Ven-
ezuela and in other parts of the world,
but in this case, in Venezuela; who has
traveled there at a time when people
could not travel—certainly from the
Congress—in an effort to see if there
was a pathway forward and to see the
plight of the Venezuelan people. I real-
ly appreciate his cosponsorship with
me on this temporary protected status
for Venezuelans. His leadership is criti-
cally important, not only as the Demo-
cratic whip but also as a senior mem-
ber of the Judiciary Committee that I
hope can take up this legislation.
I will say this: I regret that our col-
league from Utah, No. 1, objected, and
No. 2, left. I would just make two ob-
servations on his comments. No. 1,
there was a strong bipartisan vote in
the House of Representatives. So, no,
there was not unanimity, but there was
a strong bipartisan vote in the House
of Representatives. Secondly, this leg-
islation has been over here in the Sen-
ate for some time. We have offered it
for some time, so it is not new.
Thirdly, I would just say as to wheth-
er we get to legislate in this Chamber,
that depends on the majority leader
and his side of the aisle, who control
the floor. We would like to see legis-
lating take place. We would be happy
to have a debate on the fierce urgency
of this as it relates to this issue of
TPS, temporary protected status.
I fear my colleague was unaware of
what he objected to. This is urgently
needed legislation that would have
granted that temporary—underline
temporary—protected status. This is a
class of people who need to be pro-
tected, the approximately 200,000 Ven-
ezuelans currently residing in the
United States.
As we all know, the Maduro regime
has created an unprecedented humani-
tarian crisis in Venezuela that has now
forced more than 4 million Venezuelans
and migrants to flee their homeland—
more than 4 million. Think about it.
This is on the verge of becoming one of
the greatest humanitarian catas-
trophes in a refugee situation that we
have in the world—and that is some-
thing considering what has happened in
Syria and other places in the world—
right here in our own hemisphere.
In response to this humanitarian
tragedy, last December—this has been
around several months—Senator DUR-
BIN offered the first bipartisan bill to
provide TPS for Venezuelans, which we
reintroduced in February. Last week,
the House passed their own bipartisan
version of the legislation with support
of dozens of Republican Members. It is
an unconscionable moral failing for the
Senate not to approve this legislation.
Earlier this month, as the senior
member of the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, I traveled to the Ven-
ezuela border to see the crisis first-
hand. I returned convinced that we
cannot afford to sit on the sidelines
any longer. My colleague, I think,
would not have objected to TPS for
Venezuelans if he saw what I saw.
During my trip to Cucuta, I walked
on the Colombian side of the Simon Bo-
livar International Bridge, between Co-
lombia and Venezuela, amidst thou-
sands of Venezuelan refugees—30,000
cross each and every day—and mi-
grants who cross into Colombia each
and every day. I joined thousands of
Venezuelans who were fleeing hunger
as they sought food at the Divine Prov-
idence soup kitchen.
I visited patients seeking medical
care that is no longer available in Ven-
ezuela. By the way, Venezuela should
be one of the wealthiest countries in
the Western Hemisphere. It has huge
oil and natural gas reserves, but de-
spite that they can’t get medical care
in Venezuela because the hospital sys-
tem has completely collapsed. When I
was there in Colombia at the border,
the United Nations High Commissioner
for Human Rights issued a report de-
crying that the Maduro regime’s secu-
rity forces had murdered nearly 7,000
Venezuelans in the last 2 years—7,000.
My colleague cannot possibly want to
return Venezuelans to the cruel condi-
tions they are fleeing. That is what
temporary protected status is all
about.
I have applauded—I don’t find too
many times in which I am in agree-
ment with the Trump administration,
but I supported their efforts on sanc-
tions and other efforts around the
Maduro regime so we can restore de-
mocracy and human rights, but how
can you say and do all the things you
are doing in Venezuela and then have a
deportation force that wants to round
up these people who have done nothing
wrong and send them back to the coun-
try where 7,000 have been killed by
Maduro?
These extraordinary conditions have
scattered millions of Venezuelans in
countries across the Americas. Today
1.3 million reside in Colombia, 750,000
in Peru, 250,000 in Ecuador, and the
numbers keep growing. Colombia and
its neighbors have largely welcomed
Venezuelans as they flee a devastating
humanitarian catastrophe.
By not approving this bill today, the
United States is failing to match their
efforts and failing to approve tem-
porary protected status for the vulner-
able of Venezuelans already living in
our country.
For those who doubt whether TPS
would make a difference for these Ven-
ezuelan families, let me share with you
a few stories provided to my office by
the respected Venezuelan human rights
group Foro Penal.
Yuley Gomez is the mother of Luis
David, a 4-year-old who has a delicate
heart condition. In Venezuela, Yuley
asked for help from everyone she could,
but all she received was a prescription
for painkillers. In a closed-door meet-
ing, she was told privately to wait for
the inevitable death of her child, a 4-
year-old. Just imagine being told to
wait for a son or daughter to succumb
to a treatable illness. No parent would
do that.
After great personal sacrifice, Yuley
made it to the United States and ad-
mitted her son into Boston Children’s
Hospital. Three years later, David is

thriving, but he requires frequent
checkups and treatments that remain
unavailable in Venezuela to this day.
Then there is Leila Calderon, who re-
sides in my home State of New Jersey.
Her nephew, who once lived with her in
Caracas, is a pilot in the Venezuela
Armed Forces. He was wrongly ar-
rested for plotting to overthrow
Maduro. In the absence of evidence, he
was released from jail, but on his way
home, he received a call warning him
that military counterintelligence
agents were waiting for him. When he
tried to hide, security forces arbi-
trarily arrested his mother, his
girlfriend, and his father-in-law. The
following day, he was detained and
charged once more, again with no evi-
dence. He remains imprisoned today.
Even Leila, who has publicly advo-
cated for his release, has been labeled
as a ‘‘terrorist’’ on national television
by the regime thug Diosdado Cabello.
Let me share the story of Omar
Acosta. His brother, Captain Rafael
Acosta Arevalo, was detained on June
21, 2019, by members of the Venezuela
military counterintelligence. After
being forcibly imprisoned for a week,
on June 28 of 2019, Captain Acosta was
rolled into an arraignment hearing in a
wheelchair, visibly affected by torture.
He died the following day. The kind of
torture that took Captain Acosta’s life
is one of the many dangers Ven-
ezuelans in the United States would
need to fear if we don’t approve TPS.
The Maduro regime’s unthinkable
abuses have created a full-blown ref-
ugee crisis in our own hemisphere.
These extraordinary, and what we pray
are temporary, conditions prevent mil-
lions of Venezuelans from safely re-
turning home, including nearly 200,000
in our own country.
There has been a broad bipartisan
support for the Trump administration’s
effort to confront the Maduro regime.
However, as we confront Maduro, we
cannot turn our back on the Ven-
ezuelan people. Unfortunately, today
the Senate has chosen not to act. We
could have sent legislation to the
President’s desk that ensures that vul-
nerable Venezuelans in the United
States are not sent back into harm’s
way—into potential death or imprison-
ment. Instead, we did nothing.
This is a tragedy in its own right.
This is what we could have avoided
today. I am sure Senator DURBIN and I
will continue to push forward. We will
both challenge the leadership here to
allow us either to have this passed or
give us a vote. I think the community
should know who stands on their side
and whether they are willing to protect
them temporarily from the enormous
humanitarian catastrophe—the great
risk of the loss of life or liberty that
exists for Venezuelans in the United
States who have fled to freedom.
We are going to go out of session the
end of this week. That means all these
people will languish for the summer,
not knowing whether, in fact, they can
be deported back to a country in which
they may well lose their life or their
liberty. That is pretty outrageous. If
we can’t get it done this week, I hope
to God we can get it done in Sep-
tember. If not, I worry about a con-
tinuing crisis that will only lead to
greater uncertainty and create greater
risk to those simply fleeing freedom
and who are being, by the way, very
productive citizens here while they are
temporarily in our country.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois.
Mr. DURBIN. I want to thank my
colleague from New Jersey for his
statement and leadership on this issue.
It is time. When you think about the
circumstances, I am reminded of when
I was in Caracas last year. It was 11
p.m. at night after I finished with this
dinner with the opposition leaders. As I
was headed back to the hotel, I saw
long lines of people standing by ATM
machines at 11 p.m. at night. I asked
what that was all about. Well, they are
facing hyperinflation in Venezuela—1
million percent, whatever it may be.
Every day, these people have to stand
in line to withdraw the maximum
amount from their savings accounts so
the next morning they have enough
money to take the bus to work. That is
the circumstance. The economy of this
country has collapsed.
The medical care, which you men-
tioned, and I found at this children’s
hospital and other places, is virtually
nonexistent. Diseases, which were once
eradicated in Venezuela, are returning.
Children are dying from diseases which
long ago we believed were gone. Now
they are back because there is no vac-
cine, nothing to treat these children.
When we ask the Trump administra-
tion, which has told us they want to
get rid of Maduro, to give the Ven-
ezuelans a chance at a free election;
when we ask them, will you at least
show some sympathy for the Ven-
ezuelans in the United States who
don’t want to return, who want tem-
porary protection until this political
mess is over—when we ask them will
you give them that protection, we get
a letter from Mr. Cuccinelli, who is
now the head of citizen services, say-
ing: No, we are not going to do that.
How can you have it both ways? How
can you say you care for the people of
Venezuela, you acknowledge the ter-
rible circumstances of their leader,
Maduro, yet when it comes to those in
the United States, you force them to
return to this circumstance?
As you just described, for many of
them, you are forcing the return to a
circumstance which is threatening, if
not deadly, with 7,000 already killed by
their secret police and who knows how
many have not been reported who
could have been victims as well.
Today we made this request on the
floor. A Republican Senator objected.
The next time I am going to come to
the floor, I will ask our Republican co-
sponsors to join us. This is a bipartisan
effort to try to protect these Venezuela
people. If they will come join us, per-
haps the leadership on the Republican
side will have second thoughts and give
these people of Venezuela a chance to
be protected here until their country is
safe.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey.
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President,
one final comment to my colleague.
The 7,000 who have been killed by
Maduro’s secret police is reflective of
the fact that those who are here are
some of the earliest opponents of
Maduro—those who tried to create
change but fled. They have a height-
ened reason why, in fact, going back—
in addition to the chaos and in addition
to the danger—they are particularly
threatened, at the end of the day, be-
cause they are the ones who were try-
ing to create change and found a situa-
tion in which the threat of their life
was at risk so they came to the United
States.
Getting protected status—if there
was ever a moment in which temporary
protected status was envisioned, it is
for this situation.
I yield the floor.
Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of
a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I al-
ways find that the end of the July work
period in Washington, DC, is a good
time to take stock of the year so far.
I am looking forward to getting out
of DC in the next few days and heading
home to South Dakota. I am lucky
enough to get to meet with South Da-
kotans on most weekends, but congres-
sional recesses provide me with unbro-
ken blocks of time to spend in the
State and hear about South Dakotans’
needs and priorities.
It has been a busy year here in Wash-
ington, DC, so far. In the last 7 months,
the Senate has worked to confirm near-
ly 50 well-qualified judges, has provided
funding to address the humanitarian
and security crisis at our southern bor-
der, has given our military the re-
sources it needs to defend the country,
and much more.
I am proud that in May, by an over-
whelming bipartisan margin, the Sen-
ate passed my bill to address illegal
and abusive robocalls. My legislation
would increase the financial penalties
for making illegal robocalls, and it
would give law enforcement more tools
to go after these scammers who prey
on vulnerable populations. The
TRACED Act, which is my bill to ad-
dress illegal robocalls, is one of more
than 80 pieces of legislation I have in-
troduced or cosponsored this year. My

robocall bill grew out of the work that
I did on the Committee on Commerce,
Science, and Transportation, which I
have served on now for 11 years, includ-
ing having served four of those years as
chairman.
My serving on the Commerce Com-
mittee has given me an up-close look
at the issue of consumer privacy. Last
year, as chairman of that committee, I
convened hearings into consumer data
privacy and the accessing of millions of
Facebook users’ personal data by the
political intelligence firm Cambridge
Analytica. I also led a hearing to dis-
cuss the European Union’s General
Data Protection Regulation and Cali-
fornia’s new privacy-related law.
This year, as chairman of the Com-
merce Subcommittee on Communica-
tions, Technology, Innovation, and the
Internet, I have continued to focus on
consumer privacy. I recently convened
a hearing to look at the use of persua-
sive technology on internet platforms
like Facebook and YouTube and on
how these technologies can be and have
been abused. I believe that developing
bipartisan consumer privacy legisla-
tion needs to be a priority, and it is an
issue I will continue to focus on here in
Congress.
Another thing on which I have fo-
cused on the Commerce Committee is
paving the way for 5G technology,
which is the next phase of the wireless
revolution, and of ensuring that Ameri-
cans in rural communities have access
to the same broadband technology that
residents of more urban areas enjoy.
Last year, the President signed my
bipartisan MOBILE NOW Act into law,
which I introduced to help secure an
adequate spectrum for 5G technology.
In June, I reintroduced my STREAM-
LINE Small Cell Deployment Act in
order to address the other part of the
5G equation, and that is infrastructure.
Among other things, the STREAM-
LINE Small Cell Deployment Act will
make it more affordable to bring 5G to
rural areas by addressing the cost of
small cell deployment.
I am privileged to represent South
Dakota’s farmers and ranchers here in
the U.S. Senate, and year after year,
one of my major priorities has been to
make sure that the needs of our Na-
tion’s farmers and ranchers have been
addressed. One of my priorities right
now is to push for the passage of the
United States-Mexico-Canada Free
Trade Agreement here in Congress.
Farmers and ranchers have been
through a few tough years, and one of
the things they tell me they need the
most is market access for their prod-
ucts around the globe. The United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement will
preserve farmers’ access to two of our
Nation’s most significant agricultural
export markets—Canada and Mexico—
and will substantially expand market
access for U.S. dairy products in Can-
ada. It will expand market access for
U.S. poultry and egg producers, and it
will make it easier for U.S. producers
to export wheat to Canada.
Senate Republicans are ready to pass
this agreement as soon as the Presi-
dent formally submits it to Congress.
We are just waiting for the Democrats
in the House, who—despite the signifi-
cant steps that have been taken to ad-
dress their priorities—have still not in-
dicated they are ready to take up the
agreement. I will continue to urge
them to take up this agreement so that
our Nation’s farmers and ranchers can
experience the benefits. I will also con-
tinue to push for swift conclusions to
the other trade agreements the admin-
istration is negotiating.
Being a Member of Congress doesn’t
just allow you to push for legislation.
It also gives you an important plat-
form on which to advocate on your
constituents’ behalf with the President
and his administration. This year I was
able to help persuade the Department
of Agriculture to move the hay and
grazing date to September 1 of this
year for cover crops on prevent plant
acres. This will allow farmers and
ranchers in Northern States like South
Dakota to sow cover crops without
worrying that they will not be able to
harvest or graze them before the win-
ter weather sets in.
Both here in Congress and with mul-
tiple Presidential administrations, I
have been advocating for higher blends
of ethanol for more than a decade, and
I was very pleased this year to know
the Trump administration moved to
lift the ban on the year-round sale of
E15, which is a 15-percent ethanol
blended fuel. This is a big win for
American consumers, for our growing
energy independence, and especially for
U.S. corn producers, including those
back home in South Dakota. Corn pro-
ducers are thankful that the President
delivered on his commitment to the
year-round sales of E15.
Yet it is still a tough environment
for agriculture. That is why we need to
update the EPA’s emissions modeling
to reflect ethanol’s 40-percent reduc-
tion in life cycle greenhouse gasses,
which will boost its export potential.
Most pressing, the administration
needs to curb the issuance of small re-
finery waivers, which are, in part, forc-
ing ethanol plants to slow down, idle,
or shutter across America’s heartland.
This is critical to our seeing through
the President’s commitment to farm-
ers.
Throughout my time in the Senate, I
have been proud to advocate for Ells-
worth Air Force Base, which is near
Rapid City, SD. I have spent years
working with the other members of the
South Dakota delegation in Ellsworth
and with community leaders to build
up Ellsworth. Among other things, our
efforts have resulted in the expansion
of the Powder River Training Complex
into the largest training airspace in
the continental United States. Un-
doubtedly, it is partly thanks to this
airspace that, this May, Ellsworth was
chosen as the first home for the future
B–21 bomber, and it will host both
training and operational squadrons. I
am very proud of Ellsworth for receiv-
ing these exciting new missions, and I
look forward to there being more great
developments for Ellsworth in the fu-
ture.
I have worked on a lot of other bills
this year to make life better for South
Dakotans and for the American people.
I have introduced tax reform bills to
help small businesses, to update the
Tax Code for the 21st century economy,
to encourage charitable giving, and to
permanently protect family farms from
the death tax. I have introduced legis-
lation to strengthen the agricultural
economy, to support the Second
Amendment, to help States like South
Dakota—those that have low unem-
ployment rates—to address workforce
shortages, and much more. There is a
lot more to come.
This fall, I look forward to working
with my colleagues to continue build-
ing on the economic progress that we
have made, to tackle our Nation’s in-
frastructure needs, and, among other
things, to lower healthcare costs.
I am proud to represent the people of
South Dakota here in the U.S. Senate,
and I will continue to do everything I
can to address South Dakota’s prior-
ities and to expand opportunities for
South Dakotans and all Americans.
I yield the floor.

SCOTT of Florida). The Senator from

PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise
to highlight the bipartisan work that
is underway in the Senate to help
Americans who struggle with the high
cost of prescription drugs. This prob-
lem particularly affects our seniors, 90
percent of whom take at least one pre-
scription drug. It is critical that we
continue to build on the momentum of
this important pocketbook issue that, I
believe, bridges the partisan divide.
Since 2015, as the chairman of the
Senate’s Special Committee on Aging,
I have chaired eight hearings on drug
pricing, and we have heard so many
heartbreaking stories from people who
struggle to afford the medication that
they need.
I will never forget standing in line at
the pharmacy counter in Bangor, ME,
where I live, when the couple ahead of
me received a prescription drug and the
unwelcomed news that the couple’s
copay was going to be $111. The hus-
band turned to his wife and said:
‘‘Honey, we simply cannot afford this.’’
They walked away and left that needed
prescription on the drug store counter.
I told the pharmacist I didn’t mean to
overhear but that I just happened to be
the next in line. I asked him how often
this happens, and he gave me the ter-
rible news that it happens every single
day.
At a hearing on the skyrocketing
price of insulin, we heard compelling
testimony from Paul Grant, a father of
four who lives in New Gloucester, ME,
who discovered one day, because the 90-
day supply of insulin for his 13-year-old

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5158 July 30, 2019
son with type 1 diabetes had tripled to
more than $900, that he had to resort to
paying out-of-pocket for a much lower
cost insulin from Canada without his
receiving any credit toward his insur-
ance deductible.
At our hearing on the cost of treating
rheumatoid arthritis, Patty Bernard,
from Falmouth, ME, testified that her
out-of-pocket costs soared from $10 to
$3,800 per month for Enbrel when she
transitioned from employer-sponsored
insurance to Medicare. She simply
could not afford this expense and had
to switch to a different drug that was
not self-administered. This switch re-
quired her to go to her doctor’s office
once a month for a 21⁄2-hour infusion,
and it did not work nearly as well for
her.
At another hearing, we heard from
Pam Holt, who was diagnosed with
multiple melanoma. Ms. Holt is among
the 1 million Medicare beneficiaries
who have annual out-of-pocket pre-
scription drug costs that exceed $5,100,
which places her in the catastrophic
part of Medicare Part D. Seniors still
pay 5 percent of a drug’s cost above
that threshold, and Ms. Holt had to re-
finance her home to be able to afford
her treatment. The price of her medi-
cation is staggering at more than
$250,000 per year, and this is not an op-
tional cost. These are costs that are
necessary to preserve the lives and
well-beings of, in particular, our sen-
iors.
These stories of Americans like Paul,
Patty, Pam, and millions of others who
find it extremely difficult to afford the
exorbitant costs of the medications
they need in order to maintain their
health or the health of their loved ones
have motivated Congress to act on a bi-
partisan-bicameral basis.
The Senate’s Committee on Health,
Education, Labor, and Pensions, for ex-
ample, recently approved the Lower
Health Care Costs Act, which incor-
porates more than 14 measures to in-
crease drug price competition and uses
market forces to do so. It includes
major provisions from the Biologic
Patent Transparency Act, which is a
bipartisan bill that I coauthored with
Senator KAINE and is also cosponsored
by Senators BRAUN, HAWLEY, PORTMAN,
SHAHEEN, STABENOW, PAUL, and MUR-
KOWSKI. It is intended to prevent drug
manufacturers from gaming our patent
system.
Patents play a key role in encour-
aging what can be billions of dollars of
investment to bring new drugs from
the lab table to a patient’s bedside, but
the patent system should not be mis-
used to prevent lower priced generic
drugs from coming to market once an
initial patent has expired. Our bill re-
quires an earlier and greater disclosure
of the web of patents that is held by
biologic manufacturers, thus making it
easier for their competitors, which are
known as biosimilar companies, to de-
velop more affordable alternatives
without their being stymied by the fil-
ing of last-minute new patents that are
intended simply to keep competition
out of the marketplace.
It is particularly important that we
look at biologics. They have been mir-
acle drugs for many Americans, but
they are also the most expensive cat-
egory of drugs, accounting for approxi-
mately 40 percent of total drug costs.
According to former FDA Commis-
sioner Scott Gottlieb, if all of the
biosimilars that have been approved by
the FDA were successfully marketed in
the United States in a timely fashion,
Americans would have saved more than
$4.5 billion in 2017. This is an expert
calculation from the former FDA Com-
missioner.
Instead, what happens in too many
cases is that the biosimilar competitor
is available now in Europe or in Canada
but not in the United States.
The HELP Committee package also
includes the CREATES Act, which ad-
dresses anti-competitive practices of
companies that delay or even block ac-
cess to a sufficient quantity of the
brand name drug to conduct the bio-
equivalency test required by the FDA
as part of the generic drug approval
process.
This addresses one of the problems
identified by a major investigation
that the Aging Committee undertook
in 2016, examining the explosion in
prices of off-patent prescription drugs
for which there still is no generic
equivalent. What we found in some
cases is that the brand name manufac-
turer was making it extremely difficult
for the generic competitor to buy up a
sufficient quantity of the drug to do
these bioequivalency tests that are re-
quired as part of the generic approval
process. That is just plain wrong.
Due to the provisions in the bill to
spur competition, the CBO—the Con-
gressional Budget Office—estimates
that ‘‘the entry of certain generic or
biosimilar products could be acceler-
ated by one or two years, on average.’’
This would make a tremendous dif-
ference and would reduce consumer as
well as Federal and private insurance
spending for prescription drugs.
The point I want to make is that this
is just allowing the market to operate
as it should, with competition, trans-
parency, and an end to the obstacles
and the gaming of the system that pre-
vent lower priced pharmaceuticals.
In addition, the Lower Healthcare
Costs Act contains several important
provisions to shed light on what is cur-
rently a complex and opaque system.
In fact, I cannot think of any other
product we buy where the price is so
opaque and lacking in transparency
and in which there are such variations
in what the cost may be from plan to
plan, from pharmacy to pharmacy,
from manufacturer to manufacturer,
and that is due to a very complex sys-
tem that I am going to refer to.
At the Aging Committee’s hearing on
the high cost of insulin, the American
Diabetes Association spoke about the
lack of transparency when you trace
insulin from the manufacturer to the
pharmacy counter. Keep in mind that
insulin was first isolated nearly a cen-
tury ago, in 1921 in Canada, and the dis-
coverers provided it for only a dollar
because they wanted to make it widely
available.
The ADA chart illustrated the com-
plexity and the perverse incentives in
the supply chain for prescription drugs,
and what was clear was that rebates
are a key problem in driving up the
cost of insulin.
There is a system here that is rife
with conflicts of interest. If the manu-
facturer has a high list price, then the
pharmacy benefit manager, who is ne-
gotiating on behalf of the insurer, has
an incentive to choose that manufac-
turer’s version of insulin rather than
another manufacturer’s because the
pharmacy benefit manager is usually
compensated by getting a percentage of
the list price.
Well, obviously, the manufacturer
wants to have its version of insulin
chosen to be offered by the insurer to
its customers. So here we have this
system, which is rife with conflicts of
interest and incentives that encourage
higher prices because then the middle-
man is going to make more money, and
that discount that the middleman—the
pharmacy benefit manager—is negoti-
ating almost never makes it to the
pharmacy counter, to the patient who
is purchasing the prescription drug.
Sometimes part of that does, indeed,
go to the insurer, which can use it to
lower overall premiums slightly, but
we are talking about trying to help the
person who desperately needs the drug
and who is buying it at the pharmacy
counter.
As cochairs of the Senate Diabetes
Caucus, Senator JEANNE SHAHEEN and
I, as well as Senators CRAMER and CAR-
PER, have introduced legislation to ad-
dress the flaws in the system and to
hold PBMs and manufacturers account-
able.
We have come up with a bill that
would help to reduce the price of insu-
lin, and what a benefit that would be
for the parents of children who have
type 1 diabetes, for whom insulin is lit-
erally a matter of survival. It would
also help those older Americans with
type II diabetes, some of whom are in-
sulin dependent.
Another significant change included
in the Lower Healthcare Costs Act re-
quires significantly more disclosure on
the costs, the fees, and the rebate in-
formation associated with PBM con-
tracts. It also includes an amendment
that was offered by Senator BALDWIN,
which I supported, to require more re-
porting of drug prices to the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services
and a justification for why prices have
increased.
These provisions all build on a law
that I authored last year to block phar-
macy gag clauses.
I told the story about the pharmacist
who was so frustrated because so many
people, day after day, were unable to
afford the copays or the deductibles on
VerDate Sep 11 2014 02:19 Jul 31, 2019 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G30JY6.010 S30JYPT1
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5159
July 30, 2019
their needed prescription drugs. Well, I
met with a group of community phar-
macists who told me how the system
worked, and they told me that there
were actually gag clauses in their con-
tracts where they were prohibited from
sharing with the consumer whether it
was cheaper to pay out-of-pocket rath-
er than through insurance.
Well, I am pleased to say, in working
with former Senator Claire McCaskill
and DEBBIE STABENOW and others, we
were able to get gag clause prohibi-
tions enacted into law last year. Ac-
cording to one study, banning these
gag clauses could help Americans save
money in nearly one out of four pre-
scription transactions. So this is sig-
nificant legislation.
I talked recently to a pharmacist in
Maine who said what a relief it was to
her to now be able to volunteer to her
patients that there may be a less ex-
pensive way for the patient to purchase
needed prescription drugs.
One out of four—nearly one out of
four—prescription transactions should
benefit from the laws that we wrote
last year.
Another bill that I authored in 2017
will promote more competition from
lower priced but equally effective ge-
neric drugs, and it is already showing
promise. To date, the FDA has granted
nearly 200 application requests under
the new, expedited pathway that my
law provides, and 10 have been ap-
proved. That is a much faster pace
than in the past.
As cochair of both the Senate Diabe-
tes Caucus and the Congressional Task
Force on Alzheimer’s Disease, I know
all too well from listening to families
in Maine and across the country that
the path toward finding new discov-
eries and treatments is often long and
difficult and that success can be elu-
sive, but we must continue our efforts.
When pharmaceutical companies start
twisting around the incentives that
were designed to encourage innovation
and, instead, distorting them into ob-
stacles to competition, Congress sim-
ply must act, and that is exactly what
we are doing.
I want to applaud the work of the
HELP Committee. All of us contrib-
uted to the bill, and we were ably led
by Chairman LAMAR ALEXANDER and
Ranking Member MURRAY. I also want
to recognize the hard work of Senator
GRAHAM and Senator FEINSTEIN on the
Judiciary Committee for the bipartisan
package of reforms they produced last
month.
Finally, I want to salute the Finance
Committee chairman, CHUCK GRASS-
LEY, and the ranking member, RON
WYDEN, for taking bipartisan actions
just last week in passing the Prescrip-
tion Drug Pricing Reduction Act. That
has many important provisions in it
that will require more disclosure. It in-
cludes a bill that Senator CASEY and I
have authored, as well as many other
important provisions, including put-
ting a medical inflation cap on certain
pharmaceuticals.
I know how much the Presiding Offi-
cer personally cares about this issue,
and he has contributed greatly to this
work as well. My hope is that we can
build upon this momentum, that we
can seize the moment when three dif-
ferent committees of the Senate have
all been successful in reporting to the
full Senate three bipartisan bills.
Our HELP Committee bill was re-
ported by a vote of 20 to 3. That is re-
markable consensus.
Let us bring all of these bills to the
Senate floor this fall—or certainly by
the end of the year—so that we can de-
liver real results to the American peo-
ple by lowering the price of prescrip-
tion drugs.
We would then be very proud of lis-
tening to our constituents and address-
ing a problem that affects millions of
Americans.
I yield the floor.

MAIDEN SPEECH
Ms. MCSALLY. Madam President, I
rise today to give my maiden speech as
the 14th Senator to represent our great
State of Arizona.
It is an honor to be serving Arizona
in the United States Senate and hum-
bling to be appointed to serve in the
seat held by Senator John McCain.
Like most of my life, I didn’t take the
traditional path, but I am blessed to
have been given the opportunity to
make a difference for others and stand
in this historic Chamber today.
I love Arizona—the Grand Canyon
State—its people, and our spirit. Like
many Arizonans, I wasn’t born there,
so this is a love of choice. Also like
many Arizonans, I first came to the
State on a military assignment in the
summer of 1990 to attend pilot training
at Williams Air Force Base, now home
to a thriving industrial park called
Mesa Gateway.
I fell in love with Arizona right away
and was fortunate to have the majestic
view from the sky as a pilot. What a
privilege to live in a land of adventure
that I had only read about as a kid,
home to one of the seven natural won-
ders of the world in the Grand Canyon
and our diverse landscapes, mountains,
canyons, lakes, rivers, sunsets, and the
powerful desert lightning.
After an assignment away, I came
back to Arizona to fly the A–10 Wart-
hog at Davis Monthan Air Force Base.
I can tell you, from experience, there is
nothing quite like finishing a demand-
ing training mission on the Barry
Goldwater Air Force Range and having
a near heavenly view of Arizona’s beau-
tiful red sunsets.
It isn’t only our climate and beau-
tiful landscapes that make Arizona a
great place to live and work. We Arizo-
nans are known for our fierce independ-
ence, resilience, heartiness, hard work,
faith, and diversity. It is this legacy of
service and patriotism that transcends
generations.
They say the best comes last, and
that couldn’t be truer when it comes to
Arizona. We were the last in the conti-
nental United States to become a State
in 1912 and have a history of attracting
adventurous hard-working people
searching to live out their dreams.
Our State motto is ‘‘Ditat Deus,’’ or
‘‘God enriches,’’ highlighting the im-
portance of faith in God in our past and
our future.
The original foundation of our econ-
omy is known as the five Cs: copper,
cattle, cotton, citrus, and climate.
Today, we still have Morenci mine, the
largest copper producer in North Amer-
ica, which I recently visited.
Arizona has made history in our own
unique way. We are known around the
world for the famous town Tombstone
and the legendary OK Corral. We gave
women the right to vote 8 years before
the whole Nation and are the proud
home to Sandra Day O’Connor, the
first woman ever to serve on the Su-
preme Court.
Arizona has always proudly hosted
and supported our troops and remains
crucial for our defense. Our vast open
land, beautiful weather, and airspace
makes our State a national security
treasure, and Arizonans have always

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5161
July 30, 2019
the oldest continuously inhabited set-
tlement in the country, started around
1,000 AD. Piestewa Peak is named after
Specialist Lori Ann Piestewa, the first
Native-American woman to die in com-
bat while on foreign soil while serving
in the U.S. military.
Arizona has a history of punching
above our weight with elected leaders.
Carl Hayden was our first Congressman
turned Senator, who served 56 years
and secured funding for the Central Ar-
izona Project to support our water
needs. Raul Castro was the first Latino
Governor of Arizona and served as U.S.
Ambassador to multiple countries. We
are home to two Senate heavyweights:
Barry Goldwater, who served five
terms, and John McCain, who served
six terms in this Chamber.
I approach this opportunity to serve
in the Senate the same way I ap-
proached my 26 years in the Air Force
as a fighter pilot and my 4 years in the
House. I lost my father at the age of 12,
so my life was shaped early on to be
treating each day as a gift. In the hos-
pital, shortly before he died, my dad
told me to ‘‘make him proud.’’
My journey to this chapter of service
has not been an easy one, but I learned
from my dad and my mom, who was
left behind with five kids, that hard
work, education, faith, and a mindset
of service to others are unfailing foun-
dations for any endeavor in life.
When I retired from the Air Force,
having served both in peace and war, I
gave a speech, and I shared some prin-
ciples and lessons I learned along the
way that still ring true today for this
new deployment here to the Senate.
First, know your oath. The oath that
I took on January 3 as a U.S. Senator
is the same oath—the same exact word-
ing—as the one I took as a military of-
ficer. The oath and what it represents
is what those of us who serve in the
military were willing to fight for and,
if necessary, die for.
During my 8-year battle with the
Pentagon over their policy requiring
U.S. servicewomen to be treated like
property and wear the Muslim burqa
like coverings over them when they
were off base in Saudi Arabia, I often
felt alone and discouraged. There was
extraordinary pressure telling the top
four-star brass they are outrageously
wrong; and me, a lowly ranking major,
had every reason to believe my career
would be cut short for taking on the es-
tablishment over what I believed was
wrong.
At the most anguishing moments in
that long fight, I had to ground myself
in my oath and why I placed service
above self. We were taught as cadets
and officers that moral courage means
doing the right thing, even if it comes
at a great personal cost to you. Trust
me, I was tested, but stayed the course.
Subsequently, I sued Donald Rums-
feld, which we all can probably agree,
on both sides of the aisle, is not a good
career move. Nonetheless, I went on a
one-woman lobbying campaign as a
regular citizen, which led to legislation
being passed unanimously, signed into
law, and resulted in overturning this
demeaning discriminatory policy. It
took 8 years to win, but by all meas-
ures, it was worth it.
I credit that oath. It gave me pur-
pose. It gave me power. It enabled one
woman, opposed by the entire Depart-
ment of Defense, to endure and, as a re-
sult, change the world. So this is how I
plan to serve Arizona in this body:
standing up for what is right in the
same fighting spirit that comes with
living up to my oath of service.
Next, the question is, is this a job, a
career, or a calling? A job brings a pay-
check, provides certainty, and pays the
bills. A career can sound noble at its
surface, but if someone is only focused
on a career path and advancement,
they can purposefully or inadvertently
step on others, not be a good team-
mate, not rock the boat to do the right
thing, make decisions based on fear. A
career focus can foster risk aversion
and selfish motives. A calling, however,
is being a part of something greater
than yourself.
Just like my time in uniform and in
that message I gave at my retirement,
I approach my time here in the Senate
as a calling for this season and this
moment in time. I get up every day
with a focus of what I can do today to
make a difference for Arizonans.
Next, don’t walk by a problem. It is
part of our military culture that, if
you are complaining about something,
you better be willing to step up and do
something about it. God puts us in cer-
tain circumstances in order for us to
use our energy and our talents to make
a difference for others. That is how I
went from yelling at the television in
my living room to delivering this
speech in this hallowed Chamber today.
As I learned from my dad’s untimely
passing, if these 2 years are the last 2
years of my life, what will I do with
them? How can I make this time truly
meaningful for those I represent?
The Senate was created to be the
world’s most deliberative body and de-
signed to be methodical in nature, but
it wasn’t designed for anonymous holds
or partisan bickering to score cheap
political points or clicks on stories.
I built a reputation in the House for
being a pragmatic problem solver who
understands why constituents send
people to Washington: to work to-
gether, to increase opportunity and
prosperity for everyday Americans, and
to take a stand when actions go
against their best interest. Far too
often, too many elected officials lose
sight of that goal.
During my retirement ceremony, I
concluded with this quote from a re-
nowned fighter pilot named John Boyd.
He says:
One day you will come to a fork in the
road. And you’re going to have to make a de-
cision about which direction you want to go.
He raised his hand and pointed.
If you go that way you can be somebody.
You will have to make compromises and you
will have to turn your back on friends. But
you will be a member of the club and you
will get promoted and you will get good as-
signments.
Then Boyd raised his other hand and
pointed in another direction.
Or you can go that way and you can do
something—something for your country and
for your Air Force and for yourself. If you
decide you want to do something, you may
not get promoted and you may not get the
good assignments and you certainly will not
be a favorite of your superiors. But you
won’t have to compromise yourself. You will
be true to your friends and to yourself. And
your work might make a difference. To be
somebody or to do something. In life there is
often a roll call. That’s when you will have
to make a decision. To be, or to do? Which
way will you go?
That question is what should be
posed to all of us who serve in this
Chamber today. It is no secret my path
is to take action and do something. I
would ask my fellow Senators to join
me to do something with this precious
time we have been given. I already
know so many of you feel the same and
are driven to serve. Let’s point in the
direction of do.
There are only 1,983 people who have
served as United States Senators. How
many can you name? As for me, but a
fraction. Except for a few extraor-
dinary exceptions, no one is going to
remember our names when we are no
longer here. We will go back to being
regular citizens, so it is about service
now, not self—to do something that
matters.
Arizonans, like people all over the
country, are tired of the gridlock. They
want Congress to work for them, not
the other way around. Many people
here want to protect this institution,
but the American people have basically
lost faith in these bodies and those
serving in them.
Our approval rating is pathetically
low and is likely credited to family
members and paid staff. To point the
direction of John Boyd’s challenge of
doing something, we must commit
today to stop the dysfunction, break
the gridlock, stop spinning, stop ob-
structing, start truly working on be-
half of the American people.
Yes, we live in divided times, but
there is always more that unites us
than divides us.
Since I took this oath on January 3,
my first mission in the Senate was to
visit all 15 counties in Arizona to listen
to my constituents’ priorities and chal-
lenges. It was a ‘‘2 ears and 1 mouth’’
tour—used proportionally. Despite the
diversity of our State, there was tre-
mendous common ground on so many
major issues and priorities.
Arizonans want us to promote poli-
cies to ensure, if they work hard, they
will be able to provide for their family,
get ahead, and meet their full poten-
tial. They want to make sure our coun-
try is safe for them and their children.
They want a life of dignity and respect
for one another. They want us to give
our military men and women every-
thing they need to do their mission and
take care of them and their families
when they are done serving.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5162 July 30, 2019
That is why I am going to continue
to fight to protect the A–10 Warthog at
Davis Monthan and fight for the F–35
at Luke Air Force Base, plus other
amazing military installations that we
have and their unique missions in Ari-
zona. It is why, since taking office, I
have visited numerous veteran service
organizations, like U.S. VETS, where I
heard real stories from veterans who
struggle with homelessness and addic-
tion who have since been helped off the
street and have been able to start a
new life for themselves.
Arizonans want us to solve the border
crisis and stop playing political games
with it. It is a crisis all too real for cit-
ies like Yuma, where I saw firsthand
the place where over 300 migrants ille-
gally crossed the border due to poor in-
frastructure and lack of resources for
agents, or like Douglas and Nogales,
where outdated facilities leave agents
overwhelmed with volume and leave
our country vulnerable to illegal traf-
ficking of drugs or people.
Arizonans want us to work together
to bring down the out-of-pocket costs
of healthcare and allow patients, fami-
lies, and doctors—not the government
or insurance companies—to make
healthcare choices for them. We can do
this by protecting preexisting condi-
tions and supporting initiatives like
association health plans, which allow
groups like the Southern Arizona
Chamber of Commerce Association to
partner small businesses together to
access health insurance plans that
right now only big companies can.
Lives will be saved with the medical
innovation that is happening in my
State. Arizona is home to many insti-
tutions that are leading the way to
find new treatments and cures for
deadly diseases.
When I visited the Ivy Brain Tumor
Center, I was inspired by the story of
Catherine Ivy, whose husband Ben
passed away from glioblastoma, the
same deadly cancer that took the life
of Senator McCain. Instead of being
consumed with her grief, Catherine
searched all over the world for the best
place to invest and partner for
groundbreaking innovation to conquer
this disease.
She found it at the Barrow Neuro-
logical Institute right there in our own
State of Arizona. Dr. Nader Sanai and
his team are doing amazing work and
leading in cutting-edge research and
clinical trials. We need more invest-
ments and less barriers for initiatives
like this.
Arizonans want us to continue to
tackle the opioid epidemic that is dis-
proportionately impacting our rural
communities. During my 15-county
tour, I met Jason Kouts, the mayor of
Safford, who shared the senseless death
of his son Josiah whom his family lost
to an opioid addiction. His life and all
its potential tragically ended with a
fentanyl-laced heroin dose. We mourn
for his family and pledge to end this
crisis.
Arizonans want us to smartly invest
in infrastructure for the long haul, not
in a one-size-fits-all approach. What
they need in New Jersey is not nec-
essarily what we need in Arizona. We
need flexibility and partnerships with
States. Cities in both the West and
East Valley of Maricopa County have
been tasked with the daunting feat of
keeping up with the fastest population
growth in the country but without the
resources to modernize their streets
and freeways. We need bipartisan solu-
tions to modernize our infrastructure,
including water infrastructure and
rural broadband.
Arizonans want us to ensure that our
freedoms and opportunities are pre-
served for their children and their
grandchildren. They want us to ensure
that seniors can have retirement secu-
rity after working their whole lives.
We can solve some of these problems
in the days ahead if we choose to—if we
choose to work together and do some-
thing bigger for those we all serve.
At this moment in history, as John
Boyd said, we are at a fork in the road,
and we have a choice: Be someone or do
something. I choose to act for those I
serve. I know you do too. So let’s get to
work for the Nation.
As Senator McCain once said: ‘‘Amer-
icans never quit. We never surrender.
We never hide from history. We make
history.’’
I yield the floor.

BORDER SECURITY
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, re-
cently, I joined the Senate delegation
to visit the southern border and view
firsthand the migration and humani-
tarian crisis facing the United States.
We visited the Donna Holding Facil-
ity, the Catholic Charities Respite Cen-
ter, the McAllen Border Patrol Sta-
tion, and the Ursula Centralized Proc-
essing Center. Earlier this week, I held
a roundtable discussion on my trip at
the Sacred Heart of Jesus Church in
Highlandtown. The group was orga-
nized by the Latino Providers Network
in Baltimore, which included rep-
resentatives from the Lutheran Immi-
gration and Refugee Service, Catholic
Relief Services, Hebrew Immigrant Aid
Society, and other nonprofits in the
community that do work in Baltimore
and at our border.
I was impressed by the Catholic
Charities Respite Center run by Sister
Norma Pimentel. The center provides a
warm meal, a shower, a change into
clean clothes, medicine, and other des-
perately needed supplies. These mi-
grants are very lucky to make it there.
What I saw in McAllen, by contrast,
was very disturbing. I saw many fami-
lies huddled together in overcrowded
conditions. I saw children behind fenc-
ing and, basically, in cages. Some chil-
dren wore clothing that was soiled and
had not been changed since they ar-
rived in the United States. Children
and families were supposed to be there
in temporary holding only for a day or
two, but we heard stories that families
are being held for up to 10 to 14 days
and, in some cases, even longer.
Why are migrants leaving their
homes in the first place? These individ-
uals are desperate. They are desperate
because they are fleeing violence and
persecution in their home countries.
These families are often given a ter-
rible choice to have their young son or
daughter join a criminal gang or suffer
the consequences as a family. That
means being attacked, kidnapped, and
even murdered. Even though it is a
dangerous journey, these families feel
they have no choice.
Let me remind my colleagues that
these individuals are lawfully seeking
asylum at our border and should not be
treated as criminals. We need to re-
spect their human rights, their rights
under international law, and their
rights under U.S. law.
These migrants are not trying to do
harm to the United States. Indeed, gov-
ernment officials told us that the vast
majority of those screened present no
safety risk, such as being on a watch
list for terrorist or criminal behavior,
and that most migrants have not tried
previously to enter the country ille-
gally.
I am gravely concerned about the
new metering system used by Customs
and Border Protection for those seek-
ing asylum and refuge in our country
as part of the expansion of the Remain
in Mexico program. Normally, a mi-
grant would present themselves to a
Customs or Border Patrol agent at the
point of entry and ask to seek asylum.
But under the Trump administration’s
new metering policy, Border Patrol
agents will stop migrants at the bor-
der, oftentimes halfway across the
bridge as they approach a legal border
point of entry. Border Patrol will then
give the migrant a number, and they
will have to then wait for their number
to be called before they can formally
present themselves for admission at a
legal point of entry.
How long is the wait for your number
to be called? In some cases, it is weeks
or even months. In the meantime, mi-
grants are told to wait in a border town
and tent city set up on the other side of
the border. One of most dangerous
towns in all of Mexico is Reynosa, just
across the border from McAllen Border
Patrol Station. Migrants staying in
these tent cities are subjected to vio-
lence, extortion, human trafficking,
and even death at the hands of gangs
that operate with impunity in the city,
which are effectively not controlled by
Mexican law enforcement authorities.
In fact, the town is so dangerous that
U.S. law enforcement personnel are for-
bidden by our government from vis-
iting there or trying to meet with mi-
grants on the Mexican side of the bor-
der. This is outrageous, and America
can do better to live up to our values.
Migrants who are desperately fleeing
violence and prosecution at home come
to the United States in search of safety
for themselves and their families. Now
they are told they must wait indefi-
nitely on the Mexican side of the bor-
der in, essentially, a lawless town
where they are at the mercy of crimi-
nals, gangs, and traffickers who prey
on the most vulnerable.
What happens next? Many of these
migrants decide they have no choice
but to cross the border illegally so that
they can escape the camps in Reynosa.
When migrants try to cross the border
illegally, they face new dangers of de-
hydration, drowning, and even death.
Under the Trump administration, the
United States is undermining our asy-
lum policy and America’s leadership in
the world in welcoming refugees and
those fleeing violence and persecution
in their home countries. Indeed, the
Trump administration is deliberately
trying to hurt migration and legiti-
mate asylum seekers and refugees by
making it more difficult to seek asy-
lum and deter refugees from coming to
the United States in the first place.
Proposed asylum law changes, such as
expansion of the Remain in Mexico and
metering policies, will make it more
difficult for asylum seekers to apply if
they have traveled through multiple
countries as they make their way to
the United States.
I believe asylum law should be
changed to make it easier for migrants
to apply in their home country, if safe,
and expeditiously get an asylum deter-
mination from the U.S. Embassy so
that they do not have to make the dan-
gerous journey to the United States
and try to cross our border with the
uncertainty of what awaits them once
they reach the U.S. border.
I am concerned, as well, that mi-
grants who do not ultimately make it
through the process of applying for
asylum may not receive proper notice
of their hearings before an asylum
judge to make their case. These are
people who are released in our country
but have to show up for a hearing. The
notices may be given out in English,
which many migrants cannot read. The
address may be incorrect or outdated
in terms of where the migrant is head-
ing in the United States to await their

asylum hearing before the judge. In
other words, the information may be
inaccurate, and they never get the no-
tices to appear. They are therefore out
of status and never had a chance to
make their case.
NGOs in Texas made a strong case to
our delegation to reinstate the Family
Case Management Program, which the
Trump administration has canceled.
They explained that if ICE reinstated
this program, we could see 99 percent
compliance with immigration court or-
ders without the need for expanded de-
tention and overcrowding. This compli-
ance rate is backed up by the track
record and statistics of the Department
of Homeland Security itself when the
program was in use. This program is a
promising alternative to detention
that should be expanded instead of can-
celed by the Trump administration.
Let me say a word about the Border
Patrol agents themselves. They are
trying to do their jobs under difficult
circumstances. The main problem is
the Trump administration’s asylum
policies, not the Border Patrol agents.
I hope that the recent emergency sup-
plemental appropriations measure
passed by Congress and signed by the
President will help in terms of pro-
viding better and more humane care to
children in Health and Human Services
Department custody, under the aus-
pices of the Office of Refugee Resettle-
ment. The measure seeks to improve
conditions for migrants in the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security’s custody
by addressing the dangerous over-
crowding found by the Department of
Homeland Security’s inspector general.
The bill improves due process for mi-
grants and seeks to ease the immigra-
tion court backlog by hiring new immi-
gration judges to hear cases and giving
migrants greater access to the legal
orientation program.
What should Congress do to address
the immediate needs of migrants, par-
ticularly the children, as well as ad-
dressing the root cause of this humani-
tarian crisis? I am a cosponsor of the
Stop Cruelty to Migrant Children Act.
This bill would provide guardrails and
minimum standards for the treatment
of children and families, ensuring that
government funds are not used to trau-
matize or harm asylum seekers. It
would do so by dramatically reducing
family separations, setting health and
safety standards, ending the operation
of refugee shelters by for-profit con-
tractors, making it easier to place chil-
dren with sponsors, and ensuring that
unaccompanied children have access to
legal counsel.
In terms of root causes, I have joined
with my colleagues in introducing the
Central America Reform and Enforce-
ment Act designed to address the en-
demic violence and humanitarian cri-
ses that are driving immigration from
Central America and also to smooth
the path of those seeking asylum in
this country. This bill would condition
assistance to the Northern Triangle
governments in order to address the
root causes of the violence and insta-
bility that are driving migration and
crack down on smugglers, cartels, and
traffickers exploiting children and
families.
This legislation also enhances moni-
toring of unaccompanied children after
they are processed at the border, pro-
vides a fair legal process for asylum
seekers, and improves immigration
court efficiencies. Those are some of
the things we can do.
In particular, this legislation would
reverse the ill-advised foreign aid cuts
made by the Trump administration
that are worsening the migration crisis
in the Northern Triangle, which in-
cludes Honduras, El Salvador, and Gua-
temala.
I am concerned, however, that the
President sees immigration and immi-
grants as a good political issue for the
2020 election. Congress needs a partner
to take up and pass comprehensive im-
migration reform, which I believe
could pass comfortably in both Houses
if the President of the United States
would join us in a constructive manner
for comprehensive immigration reform.
This administration has shown just
the reverse. The administration has
proposed a Muslim ban, canceled tem-
porary protected status, canceled the
DACA—Deferred Action for Childhood
Arrival—Program for Dreamers, tried
to institute an asylum ban, lowered
and now seeks to eliminate refugee ad-
missions, increased domestic immigra-
tion enforcement for nonviolent offend-
ers, and sought to expand the program
of expedited removal of residents in the
United States without due process or a
court hearing.
In many of these cases, the Trump
administration’s decisions have been
subjected to successful legal challenges
in court, and, thankfully, our inde-
pendent judiciary has largely contin-
ued to uphold the rule of law and
serves as an important check and bal-
ance against the worst excesses of the
Trump administration as it disregards
our laws and the Constitution.
I therefore urge the President to re-
verse course and work with Congress
on comprehensive immigration reform,
which must include sensible border se-
curity. Yes, we do need border security.
In these times, when we have inter-
national terrorism and international
drug trafficking, we need to know who
is coming into our country. We have to
have an orderly way to process those
who want to work or live or go to
school in the United States. But it
must include an asylum policy for fam-
ilies who are at risk in their native
country.
Let us build on the proud history of
America and welcome those who seek
refuge from persecution and want to
help build a better America.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
DEBT CEILING
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, as I
travel across Montana, I hear from
folks who work tirelessly every day to
make ends meet.
Many work long hours for too low
wages, and they face ever-rising costs
in housing and healthcare and other
basic necessities, but folks in Montana
are resilient, they are resourceful, they
know how to live within their means,
and they know how important it is to
make the numbers add up at the end of
the month.
I rise because, as usual, Washington,
DC, could learn a lot from Montana.
This week, we will vote on a bill that
swipes Washington’s credit card to the
tune of about $250 billion over the next
2 years—dollars that will come out of
the pockets of our kids and our
grandkids. Now, this $250 billion comes
on top of the $1 trillion the United
States will add to the national deficit
this year because our budget is that far
out of whack. The previous year to this
year was $800 billion that we added to
the national debt.
So to put that in perspective, that is
about $2.2 trillion in just 2 years. If you
are sitting at home wondering, $2.2
trillion; how much is that, it is far
more than $250 billion.
With $250 billion, half the students
going to college for 4 years would not
have to pay anything to go to school in
the United States. We are adding $2.2
trillion, and it is going to continue on
until we get our budget in line.
Unfortunately, this sort of reckless
spending by both parties has shown a
disregard for its impact on the national
debt, and it is now the norm in Wash-
ington, DC.
Folks on both sides of the aisle are
calling for this agreement, and they
are calling it a compromise, but in re-
ality, the only thing it will com-
promise is our children and our grand-
children’s future.
Montanans expect me to hold Wash-
ington, DC, accountable and fight back
against irresponsible spending and poor
tax policy. This falls on the irrespon-
sible spending side.
The bipartisan Committee for a Re-
sponsible Federal Budget projects that
this administration’s policies will add
$4 trillion to the debt over the next 10
years. I am here to tell you that is too
conservative a figure.
At this point in time, we are going to
be adding about $1.2 trillion to the debt
every year if things don’t change. Our
debt is skyrocketing, and guess what.
We are not fixing the healthcare prob-
lems that need to be fixed; we are not
fixing the high cost of education; we
are not investing in our infrastructure,
but our debt continues to skyrocket
because of irresponsible spending and,
quite frankly, a Republican tax give-
away for the wealthy at the expense of
our kids and our grandkids.
I have listened to colleagues on both
sides of the aisle during my tenure here

who warned of debt and how our na-
tional debt could damage our economy
and our national security.
Two years ago, my Republican col-
leagues passed a partisan tax giveaway,
drafted behind closed doors, with no—
with no—public input from Montanans
or anyone else in this country. They
promised that this tax giveaway would
pay for itself, but it did not. Let me
say that one more time. They promised
the tax giveaway would pay for itself,
but guess what. Just like the previous
ones, it didn’t.
Instead, it tacked about $2 trillion
onto our national debt, and it is an-
other example of why we can’t get our
books in order—because we have a
shortsighted fiscal approach that
makes us the first generation to in-
herit from our parents and borrow from
our kids.
My colleagues made campaign prom-
ises to tackle this debt. As a Congress-
man—as a Congressman—Mick
Mulvaney, who happens to be the
President’s Chief of Staff, pledged to
eliminate it, but this White House has
done just the opposite.
As we stand here today, the debt has
exploded to more than $22 trillion, and
it continues to climb higher every day,
despite the country being in the middle
of the longest period of economic ex-
pansion in our history.
Now, I am going to tell you it is one
thing to run a deficit when you are in
a recession—it is necessary to bring
the economy back—but when you are
in the longest period of economic ex-
pansion in this country’s history, we
should be paying down that debt, and
we are not. We are adding to it as if we
were in a recession.
Running trillion-dollar deficits dur-
ing times of growth like this one, and
everybody in this body knows it, puts
the economy on a sugar high. It feels
good now, but we all know it is not sus-
tainable, and a crash is inevitable.
The same folks who voted to pile $2
trillion onto the deficit now argue—
some of them—that we cannot find the
money to provide our veterans with the
healthcare they have earned. They say
we need deep cuts—deep cuts—into
Medicaid and Social Security and other
programs that many folks have paid
into for their entire life, but yet we are
going to cut them.
I have known, and we all know, that
budgets and spending are about prior-
ities, and it is clear that Congress’s
priorities are out of whack.
You wouldn’t know it from watching
C–SPAN, but it is possible to be fis-
cally conservative without cutting
working folks off at the knees. I know
this because, as president of the Mon-
tana Senate, I negotiated and passed a
balanced budget because the State con-
stitution requires it. Since coming to
the U.S. Senate, I have led a push to
add a constitutional amendment re-
quiring that Congress pass a balanced
budget.
Now, look, we all know it can’t be
done overnight, but in a measured ap-
proach, with bipartisan cooperation,
we can at least get headed in the right
direction. There is no reason why we
cannot make smart investments in
working families, our kids’ education,
21st century infrastructure, and the
other needs across this country with-
out bankrupting future generations.
Folks in the Treasure State know that,
and Washington, DC, needs to know
that too. It is time for Congress to fol-
low Montana’s lead.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President,
I ask unanimous consent to speak for
as much time as I may require.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
HEALTHCARE
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President,
I often recommend to Tennesseans that
they look at the U.S. Congress as if it
were a split-screen television set.
Here is what I mean by that. During
the last month, on one side of the
screen you saw the usual Washington,
DC, turmoil—Trump versus the squad,
Mueller testifying, impeachment votes,
battle over the border, Presidential
candidates posturing, and of course the
daily tweets.
On the other side of the screen was
the President and congressional leaders
agreeing to a 2-year budget that will
strengthen our military, help our vet-
erans, fund research for medical mir-
acles, fund research for our National
Laboratories, support our national
parks, and save taxpayers a boatload of
money by providing stability in fund-
ing.
I might add that this part of the
budget—31 percent of the budget—is
not the part of the budget that is cre-
ating the budget deficit. This part of
the budget that we will be voting on
tomorrow has gone up at about the
rate of inflation for the last 10 years
and is projected by the Congressional
Budget Office to go up at about the
rate of inflation for the next 10 years.
It is the entitlement part of the
budget that is the problem, which is
why I am voting for what the President
and the congressional leaders have rec-
ommended, but then also on that side
of the screen, away from the Wash-
ington, DC, turmoil, there was another
story, which is the story I want to talk
about today.
During that last same month, three
Senate committees, by my count, made
more than 80 bipartisan proposals,
sponsored by at least 75 U.S. Senators
of both political parties, to reduce the
cost of healthcare that Americans pay
for out of their own pockets.
On June 26, after 17 hearings, 6
months of work, recommendations
from 400 experts, our Health Com-
mittee, which I chair and of which Sen-
ator PATTY MURRAY, the Democrat
from Washington State, is the ranking
member, voted 20 to 3 to recommend to
the full Senate 55 proposals from 65
Senators that would end surprise med-
ical billing, increase transparency so
you can know the cost of your medical
care—you can’t lower your healthcare
costs if you don’t know your
healthcare actually costs—and increase
competition to reduce the cost of pre-
scription drugs.
The next day after our Health Com-
mittee reported that legislation, the
Judiciary Committee, headed by Sen-
ator GRAHAM and Senator FEINSTEIN,
reported out 4 proposals from 19 Sen-
ators that would reduce prescription
drug costs by banning anticompetitive
behaviors by drug manufacturers and
helping the Federal Trade Commission
to block those who game the citizen pe-
tition process to delay generic drugs
and biosimiliars.
Then, last Thursday, the Finance
Committee—this one headed by Sen-
ator GRASSLEY and Senator WYDEN—by
a vote of 19 to 9, reported more than
two dozen additional bipartisan pro-
posals also aimed at reducing the cost
of prescription drugs.
That is not all. The House Energy
and Commerce Committee has passed
its own solution to surprise billing.
Last Thursday, Senator MURRAY’s
staff and I met with Representatives
FRANK PALLONE and GREG WALDEN, the
leaders of the House Energy and Com-
merce Committee. The four of us
agreed to work together to lower
healthcare costs.
All of this work is consistent with
what Secretary Azar and the President
have been saying and doing to lower
prescription drug costs and increase
transparency.
For example, last week, after the Fi-
nance Committee released its legisla-
tion, the White House said it ‘‘is en-
couraged by the bipartisan work of
Chairman GRASSLEY and Senator
WYDEN to craft a comprehensive pack-
age to lower outrageously high drug
prices, and today we are engaging with
coalitions to help build support.’’ That
is from the White House.
Here is why this amount of activity
is, in so many ways, such a good sign
for the American people. In our com-
mittee, what we have seen before with
fixing No Child Left Behind, 21st Cen-
tury Cures Act, last year’s response to
the opioid crisis—the last of which oc-
curred, by the way, while on the other
side of the split-screen television was
the acrimonious Kavanaugh confirma-
tion hearing—what we have seen with
these recent new laws I just mentioned
is that when that many Senators and
that many Congressmen of both polit-
ical parties go to work together on a
big issue that affects millions of Amer-
ican people, there is likely to be a re-
sult that affects the American people.
In other words, I believe legislation
to end surprise medical billing, in-
crease transparency, and lower pre-
scription drug costs is looking like a
train that will get to the station when
Congress reconvenes in September, and
well it should.
The cost of healthcare is Americans’
No. 1 financial concern, according to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5166 July 30, 2019
Gallup, and at one hearing before our
Health Committee, experts from the
National Academy of Medicine testi-
fied that up to half of what our country
spends on healthcare is unnecessary.
That is such a startling fact that I
sat down then with Senator MURRAY
and with Senators GRASSLEY and
WYDEN and with Senators GRAHAM and
FEINSTEIN, and I said to the leaders of
those committees: Surely, if the ex-
perts say that half of what we are
spending is unnecessary, Democrats
and Republicans can find some things
we can agree on that reduce the cost of
what we pay for healthcare out of our
own pocket, and we have.
The work of these three committees,
more than 80 proposals from 75 Sen-
ators, is the result of that work over
the last 6 months.
Let me say a word about perhaps the
most visible proposal in the Health
Committee’s bill. Surprise medical bill-
ing is one of the most urgent problems
that the House, the Senate, and the
President are trying to fix.
After about 20 percent of all emer-
gency room visits, patients are sur-
prised a few months later to receive an
unexpected bill. It could range from
$300 to $3,000 to $30,000. This happens
because patients see a doctor they
didn’t choose, either because of emer-
gency care at an out-of-network hos-
pital or because an out-of-network doc-
tor, not chosen by the patient, treats
them at an in-network hospital.
In his State of the Union Address and
again at a White House event in May,
President Trump called for an end to
surprise billing. At the event, he gave
me a copy of this medical bill, which
we have enlarged on this chart. It was
a bill sent to Liz Moreno, a Texas col-
lege student who had back surgery, and
during a postsurgery followup visit, her
doctor ordered a urine test. A year
later, this bill showed up: $17,850 for a
urine test. That is about the price of a
new Nissan Sentra. The bill was sky
high because the lab that ran the test—
a lab Liz did not choose—was consid-
ered out of network by her insurer.
Take Drew Calver, a Texan who told
the President his story about getting
$110,000 in bills—the emergency room
he was rushed to during his heart at-
tack was out of network and so were
the doctors who treated him.
That day, the President said: ‘‘For
too long, surprise billings . . . have left
some patients with thousands of dol-
lars of unexpected and unjustified
charges. . . . So this must end.’’
The Lower Health Care Costs Act the
Senate Health Committee passed last
month by a vote of 20 to 3 would have
protected Liz and Drew from receiving
those surprise bills. Here is how it
works: Insurance companies would pay
out-of-network doctors a local, mar-
ket-driven benchmark rate, which
would be the same local, market-based
rate that insurers negotiated with doc-
tors who agreed to be in network. Obvi-
ously, this would have saved Liz and
Drew because they wouldn’t have got-
ten a surprise medical bill.
The Congressional Budget Office says
that by ending surprise medical billing,
this approach would generally lower
health insurance premiums. CBO also
estimates that the approach would
save taxpayers $25 billion over the next
10 years.
Based on data from Kaiser, only
about 5 percent of doctors at 10 percent
of hospitals send most of these surprise
medical bills. So our solution pri-
marily affects those doctors whom pa-
tients have little control over choos-
ing—anesthesiologists, radiologists, pa-
thologists, emergency room doctors,
and neonatologists. It does not affect
doctors whom a patient can choose,
such as cardiologists or primary care
doctors or pediatricians. In fact, the
American Academy of Family Physi-
cians, representing primary care doc-
tors, supports our Lower Health Care
Costs Act that ends surprise medical
billing.
Over the 17 hearings our Health Com-
mittee conducted in developing our
legislation, we heard many stories
about surprise billing. Here are a few.
Todd, a Knoxville father who wrote
me, took his son to the emergency
room after a bicycle accident. Todd
was surprised when a few months later
he received a bill for $1,800—because,
even though the emergency room was
in network, the doctor who treated his
son was not.
Ahead of the birth of their first child,
Danny and his wife Linda, from Geor-
gia, chose an in-network doctor and
hospital. Of course, they thought their
insurance would cover their bills. When
Luke was born 3 weeks premature, he
had to spend 11 days at the in-network
hospital’s neonatal care center. In the
weeks after Luke went home, $4,279 in
bills were sent to Danny and Linda be-
cause the neonatal care center, located
in their in-network hospital, was out of
network.
Carrie Wallinger, from Phoenix, AZ,
received a $9,000 surprise medical bill
after going to an in-network emer-
gency room after her dog bit her finger.
The doctor who came to stitch up her
finger was from an out-of-network fa-
cility, and so she got an unexpected
$9,000 surprise bill.
A South Carolina woman who had to
have an emergency C-section received
a $15,000 bill from an out-of-network
anesthesiologist.
Usually when you are being wheeled
into an emergency room for an emer-
gency operation, you are not thinking
about choosing a doctor, and you are
not interviewing them about whether
they are in network or out of network.
In Texas, after an ATV crushed his
arm, Dr. Naveed Khan, a radiologist,
needed advanced medical care. The
cost of a 108-mile trip in an out-of-net-
work helicopter cost $44,631.
Nicole Briggs, from Colorado, had
emergency surgery to remove her ap-
pendix at an in-network hospital. She
owed $4,727 because the surgeon was
out of network.
In Mississippi, Stacy White took her
husband to the emergency room at an
in-network hospital. The emergency
physician who saw her husband was out
of network, and to her surprise, they
received a bill for $2,700.
West Coz, a 3-year-old with a 107-de-
gree fever, was airlifted from a small
community in West Virginia to a more
advanced hospital 75 miles away. His
parents were left with a $45,000 bill for
the helicopter.
In Maine, the State representative
who sponsored a bill to protect pa-
tients against surprise bills received a
several-hundred-dollar bill himself be-
cause the radiologist who read his
daughter’s x-ray was out of network
even though he took his daughter to an
in-network hospital.
There are many more stories I could
tell, but the bottom line is, in each
case, this happened because the patient
almost always had little choice. If you
don’t have choice, then you really
don’t have a functioning market. It is
a market failure.
One reason for the uptick in surprise
bills is that this market failure is now
being exploited by private equity
firms. Oftentimes, hospitals will con-
tract with a company to staff their
emergency rooms and hospitals. These
companies will handle billing, manage
schedules, and hire doctors to staff the
hospital emergency room.
Here is some research done by Yale
economist Zack Cooper. He found that
two of the leading staffing companies—
both backed by private equity firms—
significantly increase the rate of out-
of-network billing in a hospital once
the firms are hired.
In the case of one of the physician
staffing companies that Cooper stud-
ied, a large insurer’s data showed that
the cases of surprise billing increased
by 100 percent at six different hospitals
once this physician staffing firm took
over those hospitals’ emergency rooms.
In a New York Times article, Cooper
described the 100-percent jump in sur-
prise bills once these private equity-
backed staffing companies entered by
saying it was ‘‘almost . . . like a light
switch was being flipped on.’’
In Axios, Cooper said: ‘‘If you’re will-
ing to engage in some fairly unsavory
billing practices, (these services) could
be quite lucrative. . . . That’s just dis-
couraging, and it makes people want to
go to single payer.’’ These surprise bill
abuses make Americans want to go to
single payer.
Our goal is to protect patients, not
private equity firms and companies
that are taking advantage of patients.
Surprise medical bills are one of the
most visible problems for the 180 mil-
lion Americans who get their health in-
surance on the job.
When growing numbers of patients
are receiving surprise medical bills
that could bankrupt their families, it
is time for Congress to act. If Congress
can’t fix such an obvious market fail-
ure in healthcare, pressure will only
grow for a radical Federal takeover of
healthcare that will take away private
insurance from the 180 million Ameri-
cans who get insurance on the job and

leave patients with less choice, fewer
doctors, and worse healthcare.
Avik Roy wrote in Forbes that ‘‘if we
do nothing [to address surprise medical
bills], the problem will get far worse. If
we do something that is too incre-
mental, we’ll pat ourselves on the back
and then be forced to revisit the prob-
lem in a few years. Americans deserve
market-based alternatives to single-
payer health care. Without reform of
exploitive hospital prices, we’ll never
get there.’’
Americans want to be mindful con-
sumers of healthcare. When Todd, the
Knoxville father, wrote me, he said: ‘‘If
I’m expected to be a conscientious con-
sumer of my own health care needs, I
need a little more help.’’ In other
words, he needs for Congress to end
surprise medical bills.
It is unacceptable to say to patients
that, even by paying their premiums
every month, even by researching and
choosing in-network hospitals and doc-
tors, they may be on the hook for thou-
sands of unexpected dollars because of
a surprise bill over which they had no
control.
At least 75 Senators and the Presi-
dent of the United States have made it
clear that our intent is to end surprise
billing and to reduce what Americans
pay out of pocket for their healthcare.
When Congress reconvenes in Sep-
tember, I would encourage all of my
colleagues to support these efforts to
reduce healthcare costs.
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

ator from Maryland.

Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I
am here on the Senate floor today with
my friend and colleague, the senior
Senator from the State of Maryland,
Mr. CARDIN, and I think we both agree
that we would rather not be here today
to talk about this subject. But I feel
compelled to come to the Senate floor
today because, in my view, we have a
duty to speak out when the President
of the United States of America en-
gages in conduct that brings dishonor
and disgrace to the Office of the Presi-
dency. That is what we witnessed, once
again, over the weekend when Presi-
dent Trump unleashed a torrent of per-
sonal, nasty, and racist attacks on
Congressman ELIJAH CUMMINGS and the
city of Baltimore, and President
Trump has continued his poisonous
barrage for days.
Congressman CUMMINGS can defend
himself. He grew up having to confront
racist bullies. In the face of these at-
tacks, he has shown great strength and
great integrity—the same strength and
integrity he has brought to his efforts
to fight for his dear city of Baltimore,
his entire congressional district, and
his constituents over many years.
Baltimore is a great American city
with great people, great spirit, and
great heart. Yes, of course, Baltimore
faces many challenges. It is facing
those challenges with determination,
with unity, and with grit. The Presi-
dent’s attacks on this great American
city have only served to rally the peo-
ple of Baltimore, the people of Mary-
land, and, in fact, the people of the
United States of America to support
the city and the people of Baltimore.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD an
op-ed that appeared in the Baltimore
Sun today entitled ‘‘Baltimore leaders:
‘Proud not only to be in Baltimore, but
of Baltimore.’ ’’
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
[From the Baltimore Sun, July 30, 2019]
BALTIMORE LEADERS: ‘PROUD NOT ONLY TO
BE IN BALTIMORE, BUT OF BALTIMORE’
(By Ronald J. Daniels and Kevin Plank)
We are proud and privileged to call Balti-
more home. Baltimore is a city of creativity,
optimism, and determination. Home to lead-
ing public and private research universities,
world-class medical institutions, and a di-
verse business community, Baltimore is a
city where both artists and start-ups thrive.
From creating one of the nation’s first ra-
cially integrated library systems to pro-
ducing today’s modern medical and techno-
logical breakthroughs, our city has a proud
legacy of leadership in improving lives and
setting a national example for a stronger to-
morrow. It’s no wonder we are often named
as a place where millennials are moving and
staying. This is a city where people not only
want to live, but love to live.
That is why we, as leaders of 10 of Balti-
more’s anchor institutions, reject the recent
unfair and ungenerous characterizations of
our great city and its region. Like so many
cities across America, Baltimore is a place of
paradox, at once vibrant and full of promise
and yet also burdened by the weight of gen-
erations of racial and economic inequities,
deindustrialization, and disinvestment. Like
other cities of our size and history, we face
urgent challenges with crime, housing equity
and our education system. But like all Amer-
icans, Baltimoreans deserve respect, support
and steadfast partnership from elected offi-
cials at every level.
Baltimore is not and will not be defined by
our challenges. What defines us is that we
continually meet those challenges with resil-
ience and persistence, that we invest in inno-
vation for Baltimore and for the nation, and
that we harness the talent of so many excep-
tional individuals to create opportunity not
for the few, but for the many.
Baltimore’s remarkable people include
icons past and present like Supreme Court
justice Thurgood Marshall; the longest serv-
ing woman in Congress, Sen. Barbara Mikul-
ski; and Rep. Elijah Cummings, outspoken
advocate for all his constituents, from west
Baltimore to Catonsville and beyond. These
leaders are known not only for their deep
commitment to our city and communities,
but for their stature and public service on
the national stage.
We see the promise of Baltimore because
we are fortunate to work, serve and live
here, alongside our colleagues, employees,
students and neighbors. Such promise is
proven daily in our shared commitment to
our city’s growth and the success of its resi-
dents. Baltimore fosters talent in its strong
academic institutions and has seen rising
venture capital investment in its busi-
nesses—a testament to the dynamism and in-
novative spirit of our businesses large and
small. Our leading businesses and non-prof-
its, called upon and supported by our vibrant
faith community, launched BLocal, a tar-
geted economic investment and community
development plan that over three years has
invested more than $280 million and hired
more than 1,700 Baltimore residents in un-
derserved neighborhoods. BLocal expresses
to the fullest the deep and long-term invest-
ment of the city’s anchor institutions.
We never move forward as a community—
or indeed, a nation—by denigrating each
other. Nor does it serve any of us to demean
a vibrant city and its citizens who exemplify
those most American of qualities: can-do op-
timism, grit and creativity.
Justice Thurgood Marshall wisely coun-
seled that ‘‘In recognizing the humanity of
our fellow beings, we pay ourselves the high-
est tribute.’’ And as this city has shown,
time and again, when we work together, we
rise together. For this and so many reasons
we are proud not only to be in Baltimore,
but of Baltimore.
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. This is signed by
many of the leaders in our community,
including the President of Johns Hop-
kins University; the head of Under Ar-
mour, a great American company; the
head of a number of major companies
in the city of Baltimore; the Casey
Foundation; Morgan State University,
a great HBCU; Eddie Brown, one of our
great civic leaders; and many other
leaders of Baltimore—diverse leaders
who have come together to stand up
with pride for the city of Baltimore.
I would like to read to the Senate
what they say in the first paragraph:
We are proud and privileged to call Balti-
more home. Baltimore is a city of creativity,
optimism, and determination. Home to lead-
ing public and private research universities,
world-class medical institutions, and a di-
verse business community, Baltimore is a
city where both artists and start-ups thrive.
From creating one of the nation’s first ra-
cially integrated library systems to pro-
ducing today’s modern medical and techno-
logical breakthroughs, our city has a proud
legacy of leadership in improving lives and
setting a national example for a stronger to-
morrow.
I want to pay particular attention to
these next sentences:
It’s no wonder we are often named as a
place where millennials are moving and
staying. This is a city where people not only
want to live, but love to live.
If you come to Baltimore today, you
will, in fact, find lots of young people
from other parts of the country coming
to settle, work, and raise their families
in this great American city. The Presi-
dent may say that nobody wants to live
in Baltimore, but the facts show a very
different story about young people—
young people who understand that they
have a great future in Baltimore and
are moving to that great city.
Of course, it is true that Baltimore
faces a series of problems. In Baltimore
we have had a legacy of racial discrimi-
nation and segregation.
I would like to read from yesterday’s
editorial in the Baltimore Sun.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD the
editorial from the Baltimore Sun,
dated July 29, 2019.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

S5168 July 30, 2019
[From the Baltimore Sun, July 29, 2019]
CUMMINGS DIDN’T CAUSE BALTIMORE’S WOES;
IT WAS PEOPLE WHO PROFITED FROM RAC-
ISM. SOUND FAMILIAR, MR. TRUMP?
(By Baltimore Sun Editorial Board)
It’s not our job to defend Rep. Elijah Cum-
mings from President Donald Trump’s Twit-
ter rants. For one thing, he’s quite capable
of doing it on his own, and for another, our
role isn’t to offer blind loyalty to political
leaders of any party but to hold them to ac-
count. Likewise, we’re not in the business of
defending Baltimore from any and all criti-
cism. Our city has problems, big ones, and
we don’t shy away from them, nor do we give
any politicians a pass for failing to do as
much as humanly possible to fix them. But
we are sticklers for facts and perspective,
and in case anybody is still interested in
those things, we have a few that are worth
mentioning.
Mr. Cummings has not single-handedly
solved Baltimore’s racial and class inequi-
ties, its injustices, its blight, its epidemics
of lead poisoning and asthma, its violence or,
indeed, its problems with rats. And he has
been in office for a long time, more than 30
years between Congress and the Maryland
House of Delegates. But Baltimore’s prob-
lems go back a lot farther than that.
President Trump, whose early career was
marred by a federal housing discrimination
suit, may be interested to know that Balti-
more was something of a pioneer in that re-
gard. It enacted the first housing segregation
ordinances, which were soon invalidated by
the Supreme Court, leading to subtler and
more nefarious tactics. Racially restrictive
covenants, privately enforced, prevented the
sale of homes in certain neighborhoods to
minorities. Redlining prevented minorities
from getting financing to buy homes in
white neighborhoods. And blockbusting
made rich the unscrupulous men who cap-
italized on racism and fear to drive white
flight. They profiteered on blacks who
sought security and better opportunities but
instead found themselves exploited and im-
poverished.
Those days aren’t nearly so far in the past
as we might like to think. Just seven years
ago, Baltimore settled a landmark lending
discrimination suit against Wells Fargo,
which steered minority borrowers into
subprime mortgages—the sort of abuse the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,
which Mr. Trump has eviscerated, might
have prevented. Landlords in Baltimore con-
tinue to take advantage of rules stacked in
their favor to evict low-income (and fre-
quently minority) tenants; in a particularly
egregious example, the Kushner Cos. (as in
Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner) has ag-
gressively sought to jail tenants who fall be-
hind on their rent.
As whites moved to the suburbs, sped along
the way by massive investments in new high-
ways, water and sewer systems, schools and
other public amenities, Baltimore City’s in-
frastructure began to crumble. Neighbor-
hoods like those in the East and West Balti-
more portions of Mr. Cummings’ district be-
came increasingly isolated from economic
and educational opportunities. (Mr. Cum-
mings was among the Baltimore leaders who
sought to address that problem through the
development of a new light rail line con-
necting those neighborhoods to employment
centers including the Social Security Ad-
ministration and Johns Hopkins Bayview
Medical Center, but Gov. Larry Hogan, who
over the weekend responded to Mr. Trump’s
tweets by calling Baltimore ‘‘the very heart
of the state’’ and on Monday by asking why
politicians aren’t ‘‘focused on solving the
problems and getting to work,’’ killed the
project.)
Meanwhile, back in the ’90s, Democrats
and Republicans both discovered that es-
pousing zero-tolerance policing was great
politics, so long as it was enforced dispropor-
tionately against blacks and Hispanics in the
nation’s cities and not against whites in sub-
urban and rural communities. Plenty of peo-
ple share blame for that, including former
Vice President Joe Biden and former Mary-
land Gov. (and former Baltimore mayor)
Martin O’Malley. But not a lot of them con-
tinue to espouse the notion that locking
more people up for minor offenses or stop-
ping and frisking people on the streets are
good ideas, as the Trump administration has
done.
The Obama administration tried to do
something about the pockets of concentrated
poverty in American cities (and Baltimore
specifically) by using federal housing policy
to affirmatively foster desegregation, some-
thing the Fair Housing Act had called for 50
years before, but Mr. Trump’s HUD sec-
retary, Baltimore’s own Ben Carson, has
been working to dismantle those efforts.
We will agree with President Trump on one
thing, though. We wish Mr. Cummings
weren’t so focused on investigating the
Trump administration. We wish, for exam-
ple, that immigrant children weren’t being
held in inhumane conditions at the border,
that the White House complied with congres-
sional subpoenas, that administration offi-
cials weren’t conducting public business on
private email accounts or that the president
of the United States didn’t look on the office
as a giant profit center for himself and his
family. If not for things like that, Mr. Cum-
mings’ role as chairman of the House Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform would prob-
ably take up much less of his time.
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Here is what yes-
terday’s Baltimore Sun editorial
states:
President Trump, whose early career was
marred by a federal housing discrimination
suit, may be interested to know that Balti-
more was something of a pioneer in that re-
gard. It enacted the first housing segregation
ordinances, which were soon invalidated by
the Supreme Court, leading to subtler and
more nefarious tactics. Racially restrictive
covenants, privately enforced, prevented the
sale of homes in certain neighborhoods to
minorities. Redlining prevented minorities
from getting financing to buy homes in
white neighborhoods. And blockbusting
made rich the unscrupulous men who cap-
italized on racism and fear to drive white
flight. They profiteered on blacks who
sought security and better opportunities but
instead found themselves exploited and im-
poverished.
They go on to make the point:
Those days aren’t nearly so far in the past
as we might like to think. Just seven years
ago, Baltimore settled a landmark lending
discrimination suit against Wells Fargo,
which steered minority borrowers into
subprime mortgages—the sort of abuse the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,
which Mr. Trump has eviscerated, might
have prevented. Landlords in Baltimore con-
tinue to take advantage of rules stacked in
their favor to evict low-income (and fre-
quently minority) tenants; in a particularly
egregious example, the Kushner Cos. (as in
Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner) has ag-
gressively sought to jail tenants who fall be-
hind on their rent.
We do have a legacy of discrimina-
tion in Baltimore City to overcome.
The President, instead of challenging
that legacy, has decided to pile on in
the manner he did with his comments.
I know that Baltimore will rise above
this. I know the city is resilient, and I
know this great city’s greatest days
are still ahead as we tackle that legacy
and move on to the future. But I think
we as a body—both Republicans and
Democrats alike—have an obligation to
also stand up for our country. We can-
not allow these kind of remarks out of
the Oval Office to go unanswered. We
cannot allow silence when the Presi-
dent of the United States challenges
the very idea of what it means to be
American, which is a place where peo-
ple of all different backgrounds, all dif-
ferent races, and all different religions
can come together: ‘‘E pluribus unum.’’
The President wants to drive a stake in
that idea. He wants to divide the coun-
try, and we cannot be silent while he
soils the Oval Office.
I ask all of us to speak out, wherever
we are, when we see this kind of attack
by the President of the United States.
It is wrong for our country. It is bad
for our country. It is a disgrace to the
Oval Office.
The one thing I can say is that, in
the face of that disgrace, Baltimore has
shown great dignity, incredible dig-
nity, the dignity of a city of people
who see a wonderful future ahead, and
we should all work together to make
that future as bright as possible.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD an
article from today’s Baltimore Sun edi-
torial board.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
[July 30, 2019]
BETTER TO HAVE A FEW RATS THAN TO BE
ONE
(By Baltimore Sun Editorial Board)
In case anyone missed it, the president of
the United States had some choice words to
describe Maryland’s 7th congressional dis-
trict on Saturday morning. Here are the key
phrases: ‘‘no human being would want to live
there,’’ it is a ‘‘very dangerous & filthy
place,’’ ‘‘Worst in the USA’’ and, our per-
sonal favorite: It is a ‘‘rat and rodent in-
fested mess.’’ He wasn’t really speaking of
the 7th as a whole. He failed to mention
Ellicott City, for example, or Baldwin or
Monkton or Prettyboy, all of which are con-
tained in the sprawling yet oddly-shaped dis-
trict that runs from western Howard County
to southern Harford County. No, Donald
Trump’s wrath was directed at Baltimore
and specifically at Rep. Elijah Cummings,
the 68–year-old son of a former South Caro-
lina sharecropper who has represented the
district in the U.S. House of Representatives
since 1996.
It’s not hard to see what’s going on here.
The congressman has been a thorn in this
president’s side, and Mr. Trump sees attack-
ing African American members of Congress
as good politics, as it both warms the cock-
les of the white supremacists who love him
and causes so many of the thoughtful people
who don’t to scream. President Trump bad-
mouthed Baltimore in order to make a point
that the border camps are ‘‘clean, efficient &
well run,’’ which, of course, they are not—
unless you are fine with all the over-
crowding, squalor, cages and deprivation to
be found in what the Department of Home-
land Security’s own inspector-general re-
cently called ‘‘a ticking time bomb.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5169
July 30, 2019
In pointing to the 7th, the president wasn’t
hoping his supporters would recognize land-
marks like Johns Hopkins Hospital, perhaps
the nation’s leading medical center. He
wasn’t conjuring images of the U.S. Social
Security Administration, where they write
the checks that so many retired and disabled
Americans depend upon. It wasn’t about the
beauty of the Inner Harbor or the proud his-
tory of Fort McHenry. And it surely wasn’t
about the economic standing of a district
where the median income is actually above
the national average. No, he was returning
to an old standby of attacking an African
American lawmaker from a majority black
district on the most emotional and bigoted
of arguments. It was only surprising that
there wasn’t room for a few classic phrases
like ‘‘you people’’ or ‘‘welfare queens’’ or
‘‘crime-ridden ghettos’’ or a suggestion that
the congressman ‘‘go back’’ to where he
came from.
This is a president who will happily debase
himself at the slightest provocation. And
given Mr. Cummings’ criticisms of U.S. bor-
der policy, the various investigations he has
launched as chairman of the House Oversight
Committee, his willingness to call Mr.
Trump a racist for his recent attacks on the
freshmen congresswomen, and the fact that
‘‘Fox & Friends’’ had recently aired a seg-
ment critical of the city, slamming Balti-
more must have been irresistible in a Pav-
lovian way. Fox News rang the bell, the
president salivated and his thumbs moved
across his cell phone into action.
As heartening as it has been to witness
public figures rise to Charm City’s defense
on Saturday, from native daughter House
Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Mayor Bernard C.
‘‘Jack’’ Young, we would above all remind
Mr. Trump that the 7th District, Baltimore
included, is part of the United States that he
is supposedly governing. The White House
has far more power to effect change in this
city, for good or ill, than any single member
of Congress including Mr. Cummings. If
there are problems here, rodents included,
they are as much his responsibility as any-
one’s, perhaps more because he holds the
most powerful office in the land.
Finally, while we would not sink to name-
calling in the Trumpian manner—or ruefully
point out that he failed to spell the congress-
man’s name correctly (it’s Cummings, not
Cumming)—we would tell the most dishonest
man to ever occupy the Oval Office, the
mocker of war heroes, the gleeful grabber of
women’s private parts, the serial bankrupter
of businesses, the useful idiot of Vladimir
Putin and the guy who insisted there are
‘‘good people’’ among murderous neo-Nazis
that he’s still not fooling most Americans
into believing he’s even slightly competent
in his current post. Or that he possesses a
scintilla of integrity. Better to have some
vermin living in your neighborhood than to
be one.
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. With that, I yield
to the senior Senator from Maryland,
my friend, BEN CARDIN.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, I
thank Senator VAN HOLLEN, my
seatmate and friend representing the
State of Maryland in the U.S. Senate.
His comments reflect the views, I hope,
of the overwhelmingly majority of
Americans. It is critically important
that we speak out as to what the Presi-
dent has said.
I have lived my entire life in Balti-
more. I love Baltimore. It is a great
city. As Senator VAN HOLLEN has said,
it has an incredible history. It is a vi-
brant city. There are so many good
things happening there. It has a great
future, and it needs our help from the
point of view of any major urban cen-
ter in America.
On weekends, my wife and I will fre-
quently walk areas of Baltimore City
in order to get some exercise, to clear
our heads from the workweek, and to
see what is happening in Baltimore. I
must tell you that it is so energizing to
see the building cranes in downtown
Baltimore building new housing for our
young people coming into our city be-
cause they know the economic future
of Baltimore. They are there because
they want to live in an exciting place
in Baltimore City.
We see the optimism on their faces as
they are doing their exercise in the
morning and walking the streets of
Baltimore. We see a great city that is
continuing to rebuild in a modern
economy. So when the President of the
United States insults the city of Balti-
more and Congressman CUMMINGS, it is
incumbent on all of us to speak out and
tell the President: This is unaccept-
able.
We know the Office of the President
is frequently referred to as a bully pul-
pit that he can use, but the President
of the United States cannot be a bully.
Yet that is exactly what he is doing,
trying to bully minorities and others
in this country. It will not work.
The bully is not ELIJAH CUMMINGS, as
President Trump called him. The bully
is President Trump. The person who is
dividing our country is President
Trump, and he should be the one bring-
ing us together.
Why does he do this? I don’t think
any of us believe that he isn’t doing it
for political reasons. He wants to dis-
tract from what is happening in this
country. In the Congress of the United
States, Congressman CUMMINGS is lead-
ing a committee that has the responsi-
bility of checks and balances of our
system to act as a check on the Presi-
dent of the United States.
Does anybody in this Chamber be-
lieve there shouldn’t be a check and
balance in our system on this Presi-
dent? Look at how he has used his Ex-
ecutive powers and abused his Execu-
tive powers and the emergency declara-
tions that he has used.
The Mueller report spells out how the
President tried to interfere in the in-
vestigation. The way he talks about
our judiciary, saying that he is not
going to follow the orders of our court,
and the way he trashes our free press—
all of that cries out for an aggressive
check and balance on the independent
first branch of government, and that is
what ELIJAH CUMMINGS is doing.
So why is the President using these
personal attacks against ELIJAH CUM-
MINGS and the city he represents, Balti-
more? To try to distract from the le-
gitimate role Congress plays as a check
and balance on the powers of President
Trump.
It won’t work. I can assure you that
Congressman CUMMINGS is going to
continue to do his work. His committee
is going to continue to do its work. I
am going to continue to do my work as
a U.S. Senator, and Senator VAN HOL-
LEN is going to continue to do what is
right to make sure we carry out our
constitutional responsibilities.
He also does this, quite frankly, for a
political appeal against minority com-
munities. That is inexcusable for any
American, but for the President of the
United States, it is totally outrageous.
As Senator VAN HOLLEN said, we
don’t have to defend ELIJAH CUMMINGS.
He can defend himself.
I have known ELIJAH CUMMINGS now
for about 40 years. When I was speaker
of the house of delegates in Annapolis,
there was a young, new legislator who
came upon the scene—ELIJAH CUM-
MINGS. I recognized from the beginning
that he was going to be a great leader,
and he showed that in his very early
years. He rose to become speaker pro
tempore of our house of delegates, and
he was a leading voice as a member of
the house of delegates.
You see, we had something in com-
mon. Both ELIJAH CUMMINGS and I
graduated from the same public high
school in Baltimore City, Baltimore
City College. By the way, so did DUTCH
RUPPERSBERGER and three members of
Congress—from the same public high
school in Baltimore City. We both at-
tended the same law school, the Uni-
versity of Maryland School of Law.
So I recognized from the beginning
that there was a lot in common, and I
wanted to help this young legislator.
He then, of course, ran for Congress. He
was elected to Congress, and he has
done an incredible job. He is a gifted
orator. He motivates people by his
speech. He is a mentor for young peo-
ple, and he has helped so many young
people with their lives.
He lives in Baltimore City in a neigh-
borhood where he is an inspiration to
people who otherwise would not have
much hope. He has used his own life ex-
periences to lift the lives of others,
and, yes, I can tell you the record of so
many accomplishments that he has.
Just this past week, along with Sen-
ator VAN HOLLEN, we announced a $125
million grant for the Howard Street
tunnel for which Congressman CUM-
MINGS played a critical role in getting
those funds. That is going to mean
thousands of jobs for Baltimore and
economic opportunity for our region.
That is just one example.
In the revitalization of Penn Station,
Amtrak is going to invest $90 million
in revitalizing that part of Baltimore.
ELIJAH CUMMINGS was instrumental in
getting that done.
In the Ellicott City flood—two floods
within a 20-month period—it was part
of his congressional district. President
Trump doesn’t quite understand how
Congressman CUMMINGS’ district is re-
districted, but he represents Ellicott
City. He was on the scene immediately
and helped bring in all of the Federal
partners so that Ellicott City could
beat the odds.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5170 July 30, 2019
When you have a major flood like
that, most businesses don’t return. In
Ellicott City, they returned. Why? Be-
cause of the Federal partnership in
which ELIJAH CUMMINGS played a crit-
ical role, as well as other members of
our congressional delegation.
Affordable housing—Congressman
CUMMINGS has brought affordable hous-
ing to Baltimore.
Public safety—after Freddie Gray, I
will never forget the scene I was watch-
ing on the television screen. We saw
the riots and the disruption that start-
ed in Baltimore. There was ELIJAH
CUMMINGS on the streets, calming
things down and saving lives. That is
what he was doing to represent his
community. That is the type of legis-
lator he is.
He has provided support for public
safety in Baltimore, for public edu-
cation in Baltimore, and for STEM
education in Baltimore City public
schools.
So, President Trump, when you say
this guy hasn’t done his work to rep-
resent the people in the Seventh Con-
gressional District, you are absolutely
wrong. Come to Baltimore. Let us show
you exactly what we have been able to
accomplish and how you can help us,
but don’t defame our city. You are the
President of the United States. Act as
President. Bring us together. Recog-
nize that you are responsible for this
entire country, and help us with the
reputation of Baltimore.
Again, I don’t have to defend my
city. My city is well known. It is one of
the great cities in America, but I am
going to do it anyway because I want
my colleagues to understand how proud
we are of our city, those of us who rep-
resent the State of Maryland and rep-
resent Baltimore City.
There is the Nation’s first Wash-
ington Monument, the National Aquar-
ium, Oriole Park, M&T Bank, Fort
McHenry. Talk about Enoch Pratt li-
brary, one of the great libraries in
America that gave free libraries to the
people of our city. There is Eubie Blake
National Jazz Institute and Cultural
Center.
I could go through all the museums
we have in Baltimore: the American
Visionary Art Museum; the Baltimore
Museum of Art; the Baltimore Museum
of Industry; Walters Art Gallery; the
Jewish Museum of Maryland; Babe
Ruth’s birthplace—born in Baltimore;
the Reginald F. Lewis Museum; and the
B&O Railroad Museum. How many of
us have been there? The great history
of the railroads in Baltimore started
there. There is the Maryland Science
Center.
There are great sports icons that
have come out of Baltimore—from
Johnny Unitas to Frank Robinson, to
Brooks Robinson, Cal Ripken, and Ray
Lewis.
We have great healthcare institu-
tions—Johns Hopkins. I just got an
email as I was sitting on the floor. I
know the rules of the Senate prohibit
me from looking at my electronic de-
vice, but U.S. News & World Report
today ranked the Johns Hopkins de-
partment of neurology No. 1 in the Na-
tion. It is located in Baltimore City,
MD.
We can go over the other great insti-
tutions we have, such as the University
of Maryland Medical Center, the Ken-
nedy Krieger Institute, and the Lieber
Institute for Brain Development.
We have great colleges, from Morgan
State University to the University of
Maryland School of Law, to Loyola
University, Johns Hopkins University,
Baltimore Coppin State, Notre Dame of
Maryland University.
The list goes on and on: farmers mar-
kets and public markets; trend-setting
writers from John Waters to David
Simon, Tom Clancy, and Barry
Levinson; the unique neighborhoods
from ‘‘Lil’ Itlee’’ to Pigtown.
Baltimore is well known. The Taste
of Baltimore—how many of you know
that the only place you can get a really
legitimate crab cake is in Baltimore
City? We all know that. And there are
Old Bay Seasoning, Berger Cookies,
and Goetze’s Candies.
There is the Port of Baltimore, the
economic heart of our State; Domino
Sugar; and Under Armour, which is in-
vesting hundreds of millions of dollars
into Baltimore City because they know
the future.
There are the NGOs that are centered
in Baltimore—the Annie E. Casey
Foundation, Abell Foundation, Center
for Urban Families, Catholic Relief
Services, and Lutheran Immigration
and Refugee Services.
I do this in hopes that the President
might be listening so that he can learn
a little bit about why we are so proud
of Baltimore City. What we do ask is
very simple. To the President: Come
and learn about our urban centers and
how you can help us in meeting the
problems that we have in Baltimore
and many urban cities around the Na-
tion. We need a Federal partner who
will help us with our economic growth
and help us meet the challenges of the
future.
It is exciting to live in Baltimore,
and it is exciting to see our city grow.
I am proud to be a Baltimorean, and I
am proud to represent Baltimore in the
U.S. Senate.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I
thank my colleague, Senator CARDIN,
for talking about some of the high-
lights of Baltimore City and the sto-
ried history of Baltimore City. It is a
history of much good but also a lot of
challenges that I recounted earlier. It
doesn’t do Baltimore City or any city
in this country any good when the per-
son in the highest office in this coun-
try launches these nasty, personal, ra-
cial diatribes.
I know the President had a history of
these kinds of comments before he
came to the Oval Office. But now that
he is in the Oval Office, all of us have
an obligation and responsibility to
speak out when he fouls the office in
that way.
If the President really wants to help
cities like Baltimore, he can do some
of the things Senator CARDIN talked
about. On a bipartisan basis in the Ap-
propriations Committee, we are work-
ing to make investments that will help
that city and many other cities with
things like the CDBG—community de-
velopment block grants—things like
economic development administration
proposals, things like financing
through CDFIs, and things like minor-
ity business enterprises. Those are four
investments. They don’t solve the
problems, but they certainly help.
Here is the thing. In President
Trump’s budget, zero—he zeroed out
every single one of those programs.
I propose a major additional invest-
ment in our schools throughout this
country, including title I schools,
which are schools in lower income
areas. That would be a huge boost to
education throughout the country and
to the city of Baltimore.
As Senator CARDIN said, we need to
make investments in our national in-
frastructure. We have a great, thriving
port in Baltimore with good-paying
jobs, so we need to expand it.
There are so many things we can and
should be doing, but the President, ap-
parently, according to many, has this
political strategy where he doesn’t
want to talk about those things. It is a
political strategy that seeks to divide
this country, not to unite this country.
If you think about that, that is a pret-
ty sick political strategy. It is sick for
the country, sick for Maryland, and
sick for Baltimore.
So I hope all of us will work to focus
on the things we can do to make Balti-
more and Maryland and this country
stronger and end this kind of divisive
rhetoric. Part of ending it means
speaking out against it when we see it.
We need everybody in this body to join
us in doing it.
Again, I think when it comes to the
city of Baltimore, it is going to rise
way above the President’s comments.
It understands it has challenges, but it
also understands it has a great future.
Let us—all together—be part of a great
future for Baltimore and this country,
and that means coming together to
serve the interests of all of our con-
stituents.
I thank the Senate for the time Sen-
ator CARDIN and I have had here.
I yield the floor.

BUDGET PROPOSAL
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to
talk about the need to fix our broken
budget and spending process.
Picking up efforts we began in the
114th Congress, the Senate Budget
Committee has spent the last several
months holding hearings and meetings
with Members of Congress, State offi-
cials, the administration, and stake-
holder groups to listen to their budget

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5171
July 30, 2019
reform priorities. Along the way, we
have collected a lot of good ideas.
Today, I come to the floor to outline
the fiscal reform plan that incor-
porates a lot of the feedback we re-
ceived. It reflects suggestions from
Members on both sides of the aisle and
from groups that span the political
spectrum. These reforms are not driven
by politics but, instead, are rooted in
fixing our broken budget and spending
process in favor of a system that works
for everyone.
In developing this plan, my focus was
on creating a durable system to sub-
stantially manage our country’s fi-
nances, to improve transparency, to
improve oversight, to improve account-
ability in the budget process, and to
end the brinksmanship in our fiscal de-
bates.
I have broken the plan down into
four separate discussion drafts, which I
am sharing this week with Senate
Budget Committee members. Each of
the drafts tackles a different aspect of
the broken budget and spending proc-
ess.
The first proposal is the most ambi-
tious. It would reorient the budget
process around long-term planning and
shift the Federal Government to a bi-
ennial budgeting and spending system.
There are 20 States, including my home
State of Wyoming, that have some
form of biennial budgeting and appro-
priations. I have long believed that one
of the most important reforms we
could do at the Federal level would be
to move to a biennial process to have
the problem only every other year.
The plan proposes to maintain the
budget resolution as a concurrent reso-
lution but with a few important
changes.
First, it would change how we write
the budget. Topline discretionary fig-
ures would be clearly stated in the res-
olution, while mandatory spending
would continue to be displayed on a
portfolio basis. This new approach will
allow each individual Member to have
more of a say in the budget through
the amendment process.
Second, it would require the budget
resolution to include debt-to-GDP tar-
gets to focus Congress on creating a
path to stabilize our debt levels and
sustainably manage our finances. It
could even provide an estimate of an-
ticipated revenues.
Third, the plan would allow for, upon
adoption of a concurrent resolution on
the budget, the automatic enrollment
of a bill that would set discretionary
spending caps—something that has
taken until right now to get done this
year—enforced by both Congress and
OMB and increase the debt limit in line
with the levels assumed in the resolu-
tion. It saves a lot of time.
The proposal seeks to encourage Con-
gress and the President to reach agree-
ment on a fiscal framework early in
the budget process while maintaining
the budget resolution as a congres-
sional document. The budget resolu-
tion would be enforced whether or not
the President signs the joint resolu-
tion.
To encourage Congress to adhere to
its budget blueprint, the proposal
would create a special reconciliation
process that would be triggered if the
Congressional Budget Office finds that
Congress is not on a path toward meet-
ing the budget resolution’s fiscal tar-
get that everybody voted on. This proc-
ess would allow Congress to make sur-
gical changes to achieve the debt tar-
get and could only be used for deficit
reduction. The Byrd rule, which pro-
hibits changes to Social Security in
reconciliation, would apply.
The plan also seeks to get legislative
committees more involved in the budg-
et process. It would require them, at
the beginning of the process, to share
their plans to address spending on un-
authorized programs in their jurisdic-
tion, as well as programs that Agency-
based inspectors general and the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office have
identified as ‘‘in need of improve-
ment.’’ For that budget cycle, the com-
mittee would have to suggest a dollar
amount for those programs listed as
‘‘such sums.’’
It would change our committee’s
name to the Fiscal Control Committee
to better reflect the committee’s focus
on setting spending and revenue guard-
rails. It would also require the chairs
and ranking members of the Appropria-
tions and Finance Committees, if not
already members of the Fiscal Control
Committee, to serve as nonvoting
members of the committee. This
change is intended to increase the
input in the primary spending and tax-
ing committees in developing fiscal
plans.
The second discussion draft I am re-
leasing deals with congressional budget
enforcement. Justice Louis Brandeis
once wrote that ‘‘sunlight is said to be
the best disinfectant.’’ In keeping with
this principle, the proposal would re-
quire reports tracking Congress’s ad-
herence to its budget plan to be regu-
larly printed in the CONGRESSIONAL
RECORD and posted on a publicly acces-
sible website. This would help ensure
that Members of Congress and the lead-
ership of each committee are account-
able for their fiscal decisions.
The other two components of this
draft deal with Senate budget points of
order, which are the means through
which the body enforces congressional
budgets and rules. These points of
order are supposed to create a mean-
ingful obstacle to breaching the budg-
et, but in recent years they have been
routinely ignored or waived.
The discussion draft proposes to
make it harder to rewrite ‘‘inconven-
ient’’ budget rules. There have been a
number of attempts in recent years to
rewrite budget rules outside of the nor-
mal budget process to allow for more
spending. There is already a point of
order against this practice under the
Congressional Budget Act, but that
point of order lies against the whole
measure, making it a very blunt in-
strument. The discussion draft would
make the current point of order sur-
gical so it would target only the of-
fending provision without threatening
to shut down the whole bill.
In a similar vein, the discussion draft
would disallow global waivers for sur-
gical points of order. Right now, any
Senator can make a single motion to
waive all budget points of order that
lie against a measure. These global
waivers allow numerous budget rules
to be broken with one vote, regardless
of whether the points of order that lie
are surgical or apply to the whole
measure. These waivers have even been
used to preemptively prevent surgical
points of order that could alter the bill
text from being raised. The discussion
draft aims to end that practice and en-
sure the ability of Senators to raise
points of order that could remedy a
budget violation without killing the
bill.
The third discussion draft I am re-
leasing deals with Congressional Budg-
et Office operations and transparency.
The CBO serves a vital role in the
budget and legislative processes. While
the Agency’s longstanding mission has
been to produce timely, objective, and
accurate information for Congress,
there have been growing calls for in-
creased transparency in the estimating
process. The discussion draft aims to
build on bipartisan transparency re-
forms already underway at the CBO in
a number of ways.
No. 1, it would require CBO to report
on its transparency initiatives, review
past estimates to see where the Agency
got it right or got it wrong, and
produce underlying data for its esti-
mates of major legislation.
No. 2, it would require interest costs
to be included as supplemental infor-
mation in cost estimates, ensuring
that lawmakers and the public have
better information about the true costs
of legislation.
No. 3, it would require public cost es-
timates of appropriations legislation.
Unlike legislation reported from au-
thorizing committees, there is not cur-
rently a requirement for CBO to pro-
vide public estimates of legislation re-
ported by the Appropriations Com-
mittee.
No. 4, it would require CBO and the
Government Accountability Office to
conduct ongoing portfolio reviews of
Federal programs to help lawmakers
identify spending on duplicative, over-
lapping, and fragmented programs, as
well as long-term funding trends and li-
abilities.
That was my third discussion draft.
My fourth discussion draft relates to
how budget resolutions are considered
on the Senate floor. The Congressional
Budget Act provides special expedited
procedures for consideration of a budg-
et resolution on the Senate floor.
These procedures were meant to ensure
that the budget is considered and
adopted in a deliberate but efficient
manner. However, arcane floor proce-
dures and a quirk of the act have un-
dermined this intent by allowing a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5172 July 30, 2019
marathon of votes known as a vote-
arama. Once debate on the budget has
ended, we have a vote-arama. Without
time for debate or analysis of what is
being proposed, this process is not con-
ducive to substantive consideration of
fiscal policy and serves as a major de-
terrent to considering a budget on the
floor. The discussion draft aims to es-
tablish a more orderly process for Sen-
ate consideration of the budget resolu-
tion that ensures the ability of Sen-
ators from both sides of the aisle to
offer and have votes on amendments.
It would change the current 50-hour
rule on debate of a budget resolution to
a limit on consideration and force the
Senate to consider amendments after
all allotted general debate time ex-
pires. Amendments would alternate be-
tween those offered by the minority
and those offered by the majority, and
the maximum debate time on the first-
degree amendments would be reduced
from 2 hours to 1 hour, to allow for the
consideration of more amendments.
Under this proposal, even if the max-
imum debate time was burned on each
amendment, 24 amendments could be
considered. Coincidentally, 24 is both
the average and the median number of
rollcall votes on budget resolutions
since 1976. Of course, it isn’t 1 minute
of debate. It would be an hour of de-
bate.
This proposal would apply only to
the Senate consideration of budget res-
olutions. It would not preclude adop-
tion of a managers’ package, apply to
reconciliation bills, or change House
procedures.
We can all agree that the current
budget and spending system has broken
down. Reforming this dysfunctional
system has been a goal of mine since
entering the Senate and is one of my
top priorities before I leave this body
at the end of this Congress.
I encourage my colleagues to con-
sider the reform ideas I have laid out
today and invite their feedback. I am
hopeful that through this process, we
will be able to reach bipartisan agree-
ment to end the current dysfunction
and put our country back toward a sus-
tainable fiscal future—and on time so
we will not have government shut-
downs.
I yield the floor.

AMERICA’S TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE
ACT
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, yester-
day I joined the fellow leaders of the
Environment and Public Works Com-
mittee to introduce America’s Trans-
portation Infrastructure Act, a 5-year
reauthorization bill that would deliver
resources to repair and maintain crit-
ical surface transportation infrastruc-
ture.
Today the committee approved our
comprehensive legislation with a
strong bipartisan vote of 21 to 0 this
morning.
As the chair of the EPW’s Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure Sub-
committee, I am incredibly proud of
this legislation, which is the result of
months of serious negotiations with
the full committee chairman, Senator
BARRASSO, and Ranking Member CAR-
PER, my subcommittee, and my rank-
ing member, Senator CARDIN of Mary-
land.
It was not always easy, but I think
we have produced a bill that achieves
our priorities and secures needed in-
vestments in our Nation’s infrastruc-
ture. First and foremost, the bill pro-
vides additional funding for highway
investment. How many times do we
hear: We don’t have enough money to
complete this. We can’t get it done.
This also maintains the States’
shares through formula dollars. That
means a rising tide lifts all boats,
whether a State is urban or rural, like
my home State of West Virginia.
The majority of these funds—90 per-
cent—are distributed by the formula to
the States, providing maximum flexi-
bility to our State programs, and with
a full 5-year reauthorization, State
DOTs will have the certainty they need
to plan their investments without fear
of lapses in their contracting author-
ity. After all, it is the States, not the
bureaucrats in Washington, that know
their communities’ needs the best.
Our legislation would get rid of some
of the obstacles the States face as they
work to start and finalize infrastruc-
ture plans. They take forever, and they
cost so much. The bill incorporates the
Trump administration’s focus on One
Federal Decision. Under that policy,
the U.S. Department of Transportation
is in charge of leading the regulatory
review process—One Federal Decision—
and it would consolidate the review of
other Federal agencies like the EPA,
the Corps of Engineers, and others who
weigh in on these projects. That means
the States will not end up in a regu-
latory purgatory, going back and forth
from agency to agency seeking endless
approvals.
DOT would also maintain a Federal
dashboard system so the States can see
where they stand in the process.
America’s Transportation Infrastruc-
ture Act directs the Department of
Transportation to work to complete its
review process within 2 years and to
push other agencies to expedite their
regulatory reviews. Everything drags
on so much, and it makes it so long
and expensive. This would push our
agencies to expedite their regulatory
reviews under its own categorical ex-
clusions. That is a fancy term for when
the Department doesn’t think a full,
costly, and time-consuming permitting
process is necessary for a straight-
forward infrastructure project such as
replacing a bridge from right where it
is and putting a new bridge right where
it is. It takes forever. So we would
eliminate that.
We also worked in a bipartisan way
to promote natural infrastructure that
will help reduce costs and timelines,
diminish environmental impacts, and
improve the resiliency of our infra-
structure to natural disasters such as
floods that are so common in my part
of the country.
West Virginia has the unfortunate
title of being in the top five States of
structurally deficient bridges. That is
why I am very proud that America’s
Transportation and Infrastructure Act
includes language I cosponsored with
Senator BROWN implementing the new
Bridge Investment Program.
This program will infuse $6 billion
over 5 years in additional funding to fix
bridges in poor condition—dedicated
funding that is essential to addressing
this problem.
When faced with the decision on
using scarce taxpayer dollars on a new
highway expansion or improving bridge
safety, too often—it is too tempting—
States opt for the appeal of a ribbon-
cutting on a new stretch of highway.
Now, hopefully, they won’t have to
make that choice and we can reduce
both congestion and the odds of a
bridge failure—something that not
only threatens our lives but also cuts
off a community while they wait for a
costly replacement.
The climate and resilience portion of
America’s Transportation Infrastruc-
ture Act will reduce emissions from the
transportation sector and ensure that
the taxpayers are not repeatedly re-
placing infrastructure affected by nat-
ural disasters.
This portion of the bill also includes
important bipartisan legislation that I
cosponsored. The first is called the
USE IT Act. This would facilitate the
deployment of carbon capture, utiliza-
tion, and storage technologies by re-
ducing regulatory obligations that the
project stakeholders would face. It also
includes the Diesel Emissions Reduc-
tion Act, which will provide funding to
States and communities to replace
older, smog-producing vehicles—like
obsolete schoolbuses—with modern ve-
hicles that use diesel, propane, natural
gas, and electricity.
Most importantly for West Virginia
and for broader Appalachia, this legis-
lation includes several provisions,
which I wrote, to accelerate the com-
pletion of the Appalachian Develop-
ment Highway System and reauthorize
the economic development activities of
the Appalachian Regional Commission.
The commission was first authorized in
1965. The Appalachian Development
Highway System was designed to bet-
ter integrate our region with the Mid-
west, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and
South. For an economically-distressed
area with communities that are rel-
atively isolated, this infrastructure
network is vital. It is vital for attract-
ing investment, creating new economic
opportunities, and improving quality of
life.
The Appalachian Regional Commis-
sion has found that the highway sys-
tem has already created and supported
more than 168,000 jobs and generated
$7.8 billion in wage income that other-
wise would not have existed. Those
wages, in turn, drive local and Federal

tax bases. Completing this system
would generate an additional $8.7 bil-
lion in annual economic activity. It
would support another 46,000 jobs and
lead to an additional $2.7 billion in
worker income. These are very signifi-
cant numbers. I can’t really overstate
the impact this additional economic
activity would have in our region.
Unfortunately, the Appalachian De-
velopment Highway System is only 90
percent complete. The remaining 10
percent generally represents the most
challenging mountain terrain, and that
means these are the costliest and most
environmentally complicated miles to
complete. We have to get this done.
The highway system was started al-
most 55 years ago. America is better
than letting an infrastructure priority
just sit around for more than half a
century with no end in sight due to
lack of funding or regulatory uncer-
tainty. This was also a promise made
to the people of Appalachia.
The Appalachian Development High-
way System completion was identified
as being in our national interest in the
last two highway bills. But it is Amer-
ica’s Transportation Infrastructure Act
that will actually provide a mechanism
to move us toward the finish line.
Beyond the regulatory reforms I just
spoke about, my language allows
States that for whatever reason have
accrued significant Appalachian Devel-
opment Highway System balances to
exchange those dollars with States like
West Virginia that are still working to
complete projects, like our Corridor H.
But we lack the resources to engineer
and construct these challenging re-
maining miles. In return, those States
that turn their dollars back in to the
Appalachian Development Highway
System will receive dollars that they
could use for any project in their State
that would otherwise be eligible as a
Federal highway project. That means
that States can respond to the chang-
ing transportation needs in their par-
ticular area. They use excess dollars
from an undersubscribed Federal loan
program, which has historically not
contributed to infrastructure invest-
ment in rural America.
This would be a win for all States in-
volved. Those needing additional fund-
ing will be able to continue to advance
the Appalachian Development Highway
System, and States that have needed
to shift their focus—say on growing
urban transportation needs—will have
the added flexibility to be able to do
that.
I appreciate my fellow Appalachian
Development Highway System State
committee colleagues for working with
me to include this provision, as well as
Leader MCCONNELL’s support on this
section of the bill and our counterpart
legislation, the Advancing Infrastruc-
ture Development in Appalachia Act.
The committee also included lan-
guage that I wrote and worked with
those individuals on to reauthorize the
Appalachian Regional Commission—a
key economic development agency—at
$180 million a year. My provision also
doubles to $20 million the funding
available for something that I care
deeply about, and that is broadband de-
ployment in Appalachia, which is a
critical tool for connecting our com-
munities and making and keeping our
region more competitive.
I thank Leader MCCONNELL and
Ranking Member CARDIN and Senator
WICKER for their support of this lan-
guage and the stand-alone ARC author-
ization bill.
Leader MCCONNELL also joined me in
authorizing the ARC to provide up to $5
million in grants to support the devel-
opment of a central Appalachian nat-
ural gas liquids storage hub, along with
the associated downstream manufac-
turing sector for it. This infrastructure
project would be huge for the econo-
mies of West Virginia, Kentucky,
Pennsylvania, and Ohio. In fact, the
American Chemistry Council estimates
that this regional market and down-
stream manufacturing would generate
$36 billion in capital investment and
more than 100,000 jobs. It would also
help keep a much larger share of the
economic value and employment op-
portunity in our States where the re-
sources are, compared to just pro-
ducing and then exporting the gas and
associated natural gas liquids to other
parts of the country or abroad.
Secretary Perry and the Department
of Energy have also endorsed the con-
cept of this project, as well as the sig-
nificant economic and energy security
dividends that it would pay for Appa-
lachia and the entire United States.
This is somewhat of a modest invest-
ment given the significant private sec-
tor capital needed to build this out, but
it is essential that the Federal Govern-
ment send clear messages to potential
investors that it supports this driver of
economic growth in an area that would
greatly benefit.
This legislation gives the ARC the
power to lead the way.
Investment in our country’s infra-
structure is vital to the many aspects
of our American life, from keeping us
competitive in the global economy and
keeping our drivers safe—there are a
lot of safety aspects in this bill—to re-
ducing irritating congestion and mini-
mizing impacts to the economy.
America’s Transportation Infrastruc-
ture Act delivers on all these fronts
and ensures that rural America will
benefit equally from these invest-
ments. Not only will our legislation
help rebuild and repair our infrastruc-
ture system, but it will also help us
create new infrastructure opportuni-
ties for generations to come.
I appreciate my colleagues’ collabo-
ration. My colleague from Rhode Island
is on the floor. He was on the com-
mittee this morning when we both
voted in favor of this legislation. It is
a bipartisan bill working to make sure
that this country sees a 5-year highway
reauthorization and all the benefits it
would provide.
I think all my Senate colleagues will
find a lot to like in this legislation. I
am hoping we get it on the floor in the
fall. I encourage their support when it
comes time for a vote.
I yield the floor.

Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I thank the distinguished Senator
from West Virginia for her work on the
highway bill that we voted out of the
Environment and Public Works Com-
mittee today and on our industrial
emissions bill and on carbon capture. It
has been a terrific working relation-
ship.
TRIBUTE TO DR. KIM BINSTED AND DR. RYAN
EDWARDS
Madam President, as I begin my 251st
‘‘Time to Wake Up’’ remarks, I would
like to thank two AAAS fellows who
will be shortly leaving my office.
Dr. Kim Binsted came to us from the
University of Hawaii, where she was
principal investigator on the NASA-
sponsored Hi-Seas project, studying
conditions like those that astronauts
would encounter on Mars. Next month,
she returns to Hawaii to continue her
research.
Dr. Ryan Edwards joined us after
completing his Ph.D. at Princeton Uni-
versity, where he studied carbon cap-
ture and storage. He hails from Aus-
tralia and is thus by far the best crick-
et player on my staff—low bar. Next up
for him will be Houston and more car-
bon capture research.
I thank both of them for their service
and their expertise, and I wish them
the best.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Madam President, tomorrow, about
21⁄2 miles from here, executives from
some of the biggest fossil fuel compa-
nies in the world will be meeting at the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce. It is a
power-packed event. The chamber is
the most powerful lobbying force here
in Washington and a fierce political op-
erator. The fossil fuel industry runs re-
morseless and often covert political op-
erations. They are defending a $650 bil-
lion annual subsidy, as the Inter-
national Monetary Fund estimates, so
hundreds of millions spent on lobbying
and election mischief is money well
spent: The Chamber and Big Oil to-
gether have stopped climate progress
here.
For the member companies of the
chamber, including companies that say
they support climate action, it is time
to confront the relationship between
the chamber and the fossil fuel indus-
try. The Earth is spinning toward cli-
mate catastrophe. Action in Congress
to limit carbon pollution is essential to
averting this catastrophe. Yet the
chamber, according to the watchdog
InfluenceMap, is in a virtual tie as the
most obstructive group on climate
change, blocking legislation, opposing
Executive action, and even seeking to
undermine climate science. The cham-
ber is so obstructive, it would be better
called the Chamber of Carbon.
The chamber has opposed one com-
prehensive climate bill after another—

first, the bipartisan cap-and-trade bill
in 2005, the Energy Policy Act. The
chamber helped defeat it with a Key
Vote Alert—a signal that whoever
voted in favor of the bill could face an
onslaught of Chamber political attacks
in the next election.
In 2007, the chamber ran political TV
ads against climate legislation, claim-
ing that it would prevent people from
heating their homes or that they
wouldn’t be able to drive to work any
longer. Here is somebody cooking an
egg over candles.
In 2009, the chamber led the charge
against the Waxman-Markey bill. For
that legislation, the chamber pulled
out all the stops—haranguing Mem-
bers, more ‘‘vote alerts’’ and ‘‘how they
voted’’ scorecards, sending more mes-
sages of election doom if they dared to
support Waxman-Markey. Since the
U.S. Chamber tanked Waxman-Markey,
Republicans in Congress have refused
to hold hearings on, mark up, debate,
or vote on any legislation proposing a
policy framework for economy-wide re-
ductions in carbon pollution.
It is not just in Congress that the
chamber wields its baleful influence;
the chamber also fought climate action
in the courts and at the executive
branch. In fact, in 2010, the chamber
sued the EPA to overturn the finding
that greenhouse gas emissions endan-
ger public health and welfare. You
would think it would be obvious that
they do. Look around, and you will see
that they do. Disabling the
endangerment finding would cripple
the Agency’s ability to regulate carbon
pollution under the Clean Air Act, so
off went the chamber.
When the courts rejected this lawsuit
on the endangerment finding, then the
chamber became central command for
corporate lawyers, coal lobbyists, and
Republican political strategists to de-
vise legal schemes to fight climate reg-
ulations. This produced another cham-
ber lawsuit to block the Clean Power
Plan reducing carbon pollution from
powerplants.
Of course, once President Trump
took office, the chamber went from de-
fense to offense and attacked many
Obama administration rules limiting
carbon pollution. The chamber even
funded the phony report the Trump ad-
ministration used to justify leaving the
Paris accord.
Perhaps, worst of all, the Chamber
has fought against science itself. It has
proposed putting the evidence—the sci-
entific evidence—of climate change on
trial in what its own officials have
branded the ‘‘Scopes monkey trial of
the 21st century.’’ That is what this
crowd was for. Indeed, the Chamber has
said the trial ‘‘would be evolution
versus creationism.’’ Guess what side it
would be on.
This is not your hometown Chamber,
folks.
The Chamber has even tried to limit
the scientific studies that regulators
could consider. The Chamber’s evident
target was public health studies that
demonstrate just how dangerous burn-
ing fossil fuels is to public health. The
Chamber is an electioneering force, not
just a lobbying force, and it spends
massive sums in politics to shore up its
control in Congress. Since the 2010 Citi-
zens United decision has allowed out-
side groups to spend unlimited sums on
electioneering activities, the Chamber
has funneled, roughly, $150 million into
congressional races, which has made
the Chamber the largest distributor of
undisclosed donations—dark money, we
call it—in congressional races.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous
consent to speak for an additional 5
minutes.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Without objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the Pre-
siding Officer. I appreciate that cour-
tesy.
Blocking action on climate has been
the central focus of the Chamber’s
campaign spending. It ran this ad in
Pennsylvania in 2016. Two moms watch
their children on a playground. One
comments on how much energy the
children have. The other says: Oh,
don’t say that. The candidate wants to
tax that energy. The ad gets even
weirder when a faceless woman arrives
in a car and steps out toward the chil-
dren. Alarmed, one of the mothers yells
the ad’s punch line: ‘‘Run, Jimmy.
Run.’’ Classy stuff. I wonder who the
Chamber was fronting for.
So how does the Chamber’s anti-cli-
mate crusade square with its big cor-
porate members?
It has members like Coke and Pepsi,
which have good internal climate poli-
cies and websites that are full of com-
mitments to reduce corporate carbon
footprints, and they have signed letters
on climate action.
Pepsi signed the Ceres BICEP Cli-
mate Declaration. Coke plans to reduce
CO2 emissions by 25 percent. It says it
‘‘will work to reduce the greenhouse
gas emissions across its value chain,
making comprehensive carbon foot-
print reductions across its manufac-
turing processes, packaging formats,
delivery fleet, refrigeration equipment
and ingredient sourcing.’’
Yet both Coke and Pepsi fund the
Chamber of Commerce, and they fund
the American Beverage Association,
which, in turn, runs more money to the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The end
result? Two companies that are ac-
tively reducing their carbon emissions
and that enthusiastically support good
climate policy have the position in
Congress, via their funding of the
Chamber, of opposing climate action
here in Washington—the place where it
really counts.
Verizon has reduced its carbon inten-
sity by 28 percent since 2016, and its
CEO has publicly stated Verizon’s com-
mitment to combat climate change.
Yet Verizon, too, funds the Chamber’s
obstruction.
Then there is Google with its motto:
‘‘Don’t be evil.’’ Google is warning its
investors that climate change threat-
ens its systems. It says that it is vul-
nerable to damage or interruption from
natural disasters and to the effects of
climate change, such as sea level rise,
drought, flooding, wildfires, and in-
creased storm severity. Google has
signed pledges to fight climate change;
yet Google, too, funds the Chamber’s
anti-climate crusade.
Coke, Pepsi, Verizon, and Google are
just four examples among many. These
companies say they support climate ac-
tion but fund one of climate action’s
worst opponents.
Why does the Chamber put these
members in this position? The best ex-
planation I have is that the fossil fuel
industry is secretly calling the shots at
the Chamber; that is, it is secretly
funding the Chamber. That would ex-
plain the Chamber’s refusal to disclose
its funders.
I think this is a governance issue
now for these companies, particularly
for those members who serve on the
Chamber’s board. Board members of
nonprofit organizations have a com-
mon law duty of care. Not knowing
who is funding your organization looks
like a breach of that duty of care.
The Chamber’s member companies
need to ask themselves: Do we know
who is funding the Chamber? Do we
know how much each donor is giving?
Do those donations explain the Cham-
ber’s years of obstruction?
The Chamber holds itself out as a
business association. Another question:
Why is it accepting money from non-
businesses?
In 2012 and 2014, the Chamber took at
least $5.5 million from front groups
that have been backed by the Koch
brothers. In 2014, it took $5.25 million
from a front group that was affiliated
with Karl Rove.
Did the Chamber’s board members
know this? Did they exercise the prop-
er duty of care? Do they know what
nonbusiness money is funding the
Chamber these days? Do they know
what percentage of the Chamber’s
funding comes secretly from fossil fuel
interests?
I don’t think the Chamber’s board
members know the answers to any of
these questions.
Here is a question for the general
counsel of these board member cor-
porations: Should they know or are you
going to go with willful ignorance?
Good luck with that.
The bottom line is simple. Chamber
board members with good climate poli-
cies are supporting one of the worst cli-
mate obstructors in America. Indeed,
they are writing big checks to do so.
This, I believe, is not just a moral
problem but a governance problem. If
these companies aren’t asking these
tough questions and if they are not
pushing the Chamber to be transparent
about its funding sources, they are an-
swerable. Until this mess gets sorted
out, in spite of all of corporate Amer-
ica’s efforts to reduce emissions, its

funding of the ‘‘U.S. Chamber of Car-
bon’’ means that corporate America is
doing more harm than good for our cli-
mate.
Again, I thank the distinguished Sen-
ator from Oklahoma for his courtesy in
allowing me the extra time.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma.
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first
of all, despite what some people might
think, I have the highest regard for the
Senator from Rhode Island.
It is very interesting in that the cli-
mate is changing, and the climate has
always changed. All evidence out
there—all historical evidence, all scrip-
tural evidence—tells us over and over
again that the climate is changing. It
always has been changing, and it al-
ways will change.
The good news is that the world is
not coming to an end because of cli-
mate change. That is because the cli-
mate is always changing. So, for those
people who believe the world is coming
to an end because of greenhouse gas
emissions, the good news is it is not. I
am happy to share that good news with
you.
BIPARTISAN BUDGET ACT OF 2019
Madam President, I am here to speak
about some other good news, which is
that we have an opportunity with a
vote that is coming up. Some people
call it the budget vote or the budget
agreement. I don’t refer to it as such. I
call it a defense agreement. I think ev-
erybody knows where I stand on this.
This is a vote that is going to have to
come up before too long, and there is a
unique group of people in the U.S. Sen-
ate who know the reason that we have
to pass the defense budget. They are
the members of the Senate’s Com-
mittee on Armed Services. It happens
that I chair that committee and that
we have done really great work.
I ask unanimous consent to speak as
in morning business for such time as I
may consume.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, we
had a situation in which we went
through an 8-year period of time when
our military was somewhat devastated,
and I want to share some of the spe-
cifics of that because it is a serious
thing. We are going to be voting on the
defense budget agreement, and I have
already stated where I stand on it. I am
here to outline why the budget agree-
ment is necessary for our national de-
fense.
This defense budget agreement will
be able to focus on the Senate’s Armed
Services’ top priorities, one of which is
to fix the on-base privatization of mili-
tary housing.
Remember that this happened about
6 months ago. We discovered, all of a
sudden, that we were not doing a good
job on our privatized housing. Hey, I
have to admit that I am partly respon-
sible for that because I was around
here when we decided to privatize the
housing. It did work for a while. I
think, after a period of time, people got
a little careless, and there was a little
slack. Some of the contractors who
made that commitment got a little bit
greedy. This information as to how bad
the conditions were came from a per-
son at Tinker Air Force Base who was
the spouse of a military person. When I
first heard this, I thought there were
bad conditions just in my State of
Oklahoma, but there were not; they
were all over the Nation.
So we fixed that thing. We fixed it
with our defense authorization bill, and
we had a lot of provisions in there. We
are now modernizing our military
housing in a way that is going to be
good for all of our spouses and others
who are forced to live there. For some
reason, if our defense budget agree-
ment were to go down in flames and
not be passed, there wouldn’t be the
modernizing of our military or the giv-
ing to our troops a well-deserved pay
raise, and they have not had a pay
raise in a long time. This is going to be
the largest pay raise for our military
people in the last 10 years. It is a good
thing.
By the way, people are always talk-
ing about how we can be so concerned
about building our military when we
have China and Russia that have
passed us up in many areas and spend
just a fraction of the amount. The rea-
son is very simple, which is that China
and Russia are countries that don’t
have to do anything for their soldiers.
We take care of ours. We try to provide
good housing. We provide the types of
things that our all-volunteer force can
be very proud of and are very proud of.
That is something we have to incur.
The largest single expenditure that we
have in the military is end strength—
the people out there. Communist coun-
tries—China, Russia—don’t have to
worry about that. ‘‘Here is a gun. Go
out and kill somebody.’’ We don’t have
that luxury, and we wouldn’t do that if
we wanted to.
If we don’t pass this budget bill, the
effects on the military will be dev-
astating. Let me just share a couple of
things that would happen.
We would force the Department of
Defense to operate under a continuing
resolution, which would shortchange
our troops and waste taxpayer dollars.
We all know that. We would face de-
structive, haphazard cuts in sequestra-
tion. What is it we hear on our com-
mittee? The Presiding Officer is fully
familiar, for she is one of the most
loyal members of the Senate’s Com-
mittee on Armed Services. We have
posture hearings for about 6 months at
the beginning of every year with the
leaders of the various branches of the
military—General Votel, Gen. Thomas
Waldhauser, ADM Craig Faller, ADM
Phil Davidson, all of these people.
What do they tell us?
They tell us, if we don’t actually
start funding our military again, we
are going to have sequestration. Look,
if we vote for this thing and pass it, we
will end the sequestration problems
and threats forever. It will not happen
again.
What else do they tell us?
They tell us that a CR, which is a
continuing resolution, would be an ab-
solute disaster. A lot of people in this
body don’t know this, but every mem-
ber of the Senate’s Committee on
Armed Services does know this because
they were there.
All of these people—16 leaders—come
in for posture hearings each year, and
we know the problems we are having
and the problems we are confronted
with. We would be faced with cuts in
sequestration.
This document right here is the ‘‘As-
sessment and Recommendations of the
National Defense Strategy Commis-
sion.’’ Here it is right here. This is our
blueprint of what we are doing to save
America and to put us back on top in
all of these areas in which we are defi-
cient. If, for some reason, we don’t pass
this defense budget agreement, then we
will not be able to continue the imple-
mentation of the national defense
strategy, and we all know that. Cer-
tainly, we don’t all know that, but the
members of the Senate’s Committee on
Armed Services do know that.
So that is what would happen. But
what would this mean? The members of
the Armed Services Committee know
what it means, but for everybody else,
the deficit budget deal would end the
threat of sequestration forever. You
don’t need me to tell you that seques-
tration would be devastating.
General Milley, just confirmed to be
the Chairman of the Joints Chief of
Staff, said that the levels of funding
caused by sequestration would place
America ‘‘at great risk.’’
Remember, unfortunately, Heather
Wilson, the former Air Force Secretary
who had to leave her position. She said
the cuts would be ‘‘absolutely dev-
astating in scope and scale.’’
If we were hit by sequestration, there
would be an across-the-board cut of $71
billion to the defense programs. That
would halt our progress on the Space
Command and developing crucial capa-
bilities like hypersonic weapons and
artificial intelligence. Those are two
areas where we have actually been
passed up by both Russia and China.
Just yesterday, the DARPA an-
nounced that they have completed a
successful design review of a
hypersonic weapons program. Now,
that is a good first step. I am really
glad because we were way ahead of
them back before the last administra-
tion came into office, and then, all of a
sudden, over that period of time, we
got behind. So, meanwhile, China and
Russia are already testing their
hypersonic weapons, and they are
ahead of us. We are just trying to catch
up, and that is what this budget vote is
all about.
The 2020 NDAA invests in hypersonic
weapons, but we can’t move forward if
we are hit by sequestration. It would
mean it would set us even further be-
hind.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5176 July 30, 2019
By the way, the hypersonics that we
are talking about are the state of the
art. That is a new thing. That is a
weaponry that moves at five times the
speed of sound, and here we are, allow-
ing our—I don’t want to characterize
China and Russia as enemies. They are
not enemies, but they are certainly on
the other side, and people are in shock
when they find out that they have
something that we don’t have. We have
to be competitive with them, and we
are going to be if we pass this defense
budget vote that we are going to have
before us.
So another example, in our NDAA
that we passed overwhelmingly just
last month, it authorized a 3.1-percent
pay raise, or increase, for our troops.
They deserve that pay raise, and under
sequestration that pay raise is at risk.
The ability for basing facilities to re-
ceive the next generation of aircraft is
also at risk. If your State is like my
State, your State is slated to house the
F–35 or the T-X trainer or the KC–46.
The KC–46 is a system that is going to
replace the KC–135, which has been in
place now for over 50 years and so is 50
years old. That is a system, and if you
were going to have one of these sys-
tems in your State, you may not get it
because of this deal. Without the budg-
et vote that is going to take place, we
wouldn’t be able to move forward with
our plan, and we would be hit by se-
questration. It could all be over.
I am talking about systems like the
F–35, which we talk about every day,
and the T-X trainer. We have had the
trainers in existence now for some 50
years, and the KC–46, the same thing.
So, anyway, that is what would hap-
pen if for some reason we vote against
and don’t pass the defense bill that we
are going to be asked to vote on prob-
ably tomorrow.
We have also made plans to continue
increasing our end strength by 17,000
troops from the Obama era to our cur-
rent goal, and without this defense
budget deal, that wouldn’t be possible.
I think we all know it.
Now, maybe we don’t all know it in
this Chamber, but as for every member
of the defense authorization com-
mittee, the Senate Armed Services
Committee, they all know because they
have been told over and over, and that
is why it is so important that they be
very responsible in their vote.
It would be kind of hard to say that
you are working for the defense of our
Nation and then turn around and vote
to gut their funding.
Now, we have made remarkable gains
in readiness over the past couple of
years, thanks to President Trump’s
leadership and greater budgetary sta-
bility. For just one example, at the end
of the Obama administration, only 5
percent of our brigade combat teams
were ready to what they call ‘‘fight to-
night’’—only 5 percent.
Now, we have made a huge improve-
ment. That is up to 50 percent now
after just 2 years of this administra-
tion, but we have a lot more to do. All
the improvements we have made in fis-
cal years 2018 and 2019 would be at risk
if we were not able to go forward and
pass our defense budget act that we are
going to be asked to support.
Sequestration would undo what we
have done and take us back where we
were before. It would be abandoning
our troops right when we said we would
be there for them. A continuing resolu-
tion means funding will go to the
wrong places—places that were impor-
tant last year but don’t need to be
funded this year. That is just wasteful.
We all understand that, but a con-
tinuing resolution would be especially
devastating for the military.
Every one of these military people
whom I was just reading about came in
for their annual meeting. They all said
the same thing: It would be dev-
astating if we had to go into a con-
tinuing resolution. We would be forced
to do programs that otherwise we
would not be doing.
So General Dunford said it himself.
He said: ‘‘The fact that we have rou-
tinely not had a budget at the begin-
ning of the year has delayed new
starts, and it’s been incredibly ineffi-
cient in how we prioritize and allocate
resources throughout the year.’’ That
was General Dunford.
A continuing resolution means that
our military will lose key planning
ability. David Norquist, nominated to
be the Deputy Secretary of Defense,
gave a great example to the Senate
Armed Services Committee last week.
He said: Let’s say a unit is planning
right now for some training in October,
but we are operating under a con-
tinuing resolution. At that time, they
will cancel training because they don’t
know how much money they would be
getting in order to accomplish that. We
may eventually get more money, but in
the meantime we will have lost a
month in the process.
With sequestration off the table and
with a stable 2-year budget deal in
place, the Department of Defense can
move forward with what is really im-
portant: implementing the National
Defense Strategy. This is what my
committee has been focusing on all
year. We are facing a different, more
dangerous world than we were 10 years
ago.
I look back wistfully. I have said this
many times. I look back wistfully at
the days of the Cold War. We had two
super powers. We knew what they had,
and they knew what we had—mutually
assured destruction. It doesn’t mean
anything anymore. You have countries
that are run by people that are men-
tally deficient having the capability of
blowing up one of our American cities.
It is a scary world out there. That is
what we are doing. That is why it is so
important that we pass this budget, be-
cause our defense is depending on it.
Not everybody knows this, but the
members of the Armed Services Com-
mittee do know it. We are falling be-
hind China and Russia as they continue
to build their militaries. We are seeing
persistent threats from North Korea,
from Iran, from the terrorist groups,
and we no longer have the best of ev-
erything, and most people don’t under-
stand that. Of course the members of
our committee do understand that.
We have set clear priorities, and now
we need to fund it. The future of our
Nation is at stake. This is what it will
take to regain the qualitative and
quantitative advantages that we have
lost.
I would have liked to have seen even
more funding provided to this. The Na-
tional Defense Strategy Commission—
by the way, they set up a system that
they can use, and that system is that
we should be putting together between
a 3- and a 5-percent increase over infla-
tion, but we have not done it. We have
not done it even with the budget that
we are working on now.
The National Defense Strategy Com-
mission, which is nonpartisan, has said
that 3 to 5 percent growth is what is
needed, and that is what we did not do.
But at the end of the day, I am will-
ing to take this smaller than ideal in-
crease and give our military what it
needs—predictability. It is also more
than what the House passed in their
Defense authorization bill, which was
dangerously low.
Every member of Armed Services
Committee should vote for this defense
budget because they know everything
we have been talking about. They
know that we are outranged and
outgunned in artillery. They know that
we are at a disadvantage in air defense,
having only two Active-Duty battal-
ions. Nuclear Triad modernization has
not been taking place. We aren’t there.
China and Russia are.
So, anyway, what I am trying to im-
press upon you is that those individ-
uals who are members of the com-
mittee are fully aware of the problems
we have had. They remember that
under the Obama administration, at
the end of the Obama administration,
our Air Force was short 2,000 pilots,
and 1,500 of them were fighter pilots.
Only one-third of our brigade combat
teams, one-fourth of our aviation bri-
gades, and half of our divisions were
ready. Also, 60 percent of our F–18s
weren’t flyable. This is what we are in
the process of correcting, and it is all
dependent upon the passage of this
budget.
So I would say to those individuals
who are on the committee, I can’t
imagine that any of them would not be
supporting this defense budget when it
comes up, and I would hope that we
don’t have members of our committee
who are anticipating doing things such
as hearings back in their State or
amendments to go as we put our De-
fense authorization bill through the
next steps, because now is when our de-
fense system needs to have this budget
passed.
I yield the floor.

July 30, 2019
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent to speak as in
morning business for 15 minutes.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I
want to inform my colleagues and the
American people about some progress
that has been made on a very impor-
tant bipartisan piece of legislation,
plus what a couple other committees
are doing along the same line of keep-
ing healthcare costs down—that we are
making progress to reduce the price of
prescription medicine for the American
people.
I have been tilling the fields of legis-
lative policy long enough to know that
we have our work cut out for us. The
ranking member and I of the Finance
Committee started out 6 months ago to
cultivate a bipartisan consensus for
much needed reforms. We knew that we
had a long row ahead. Our efforts to re-
duce drug prices face big-time opposi-
tion from Big Pharma.
As we worked side by side in a Re-
publican and Democratic way, we
planted the seeds to grow a strong bi-
partisan coalition—one strong enough,
I believe, to withstand the influence of
moneyed special interests.
Now, it should be no surprise to any-
body that Big Pharma and other stake-
holders in the drug supply chain are
working six ways from Sunday to
throw sand in our gears. We know they
will continue to fight us during the Au-
gust work period.
As a lifelong farmer from Iowa, I
learned a long time ago that the fruits
of one’s labor will not be worth a hill of
beans without proper groundwork. For
months, we have been tilling the soil
and fertilizing the legislative fields to
bear fruit at harvest time. We have
teamed up with leadership of other key
committees of jurisdiction.
Together with the chairman and
ranking member of the Senate Health
Committee, Senators LAMAR ALEX-
ANDER and PATTY MURRAY, and the
chairman and ranking member of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, Senators
LINDSEY GRAHAM and DIANNE FEIN-
STEIN, the Senate has a real oppor-
tunity this Congress to deliver mean-
ingful reforms that would yield real
savings for what Americans spend on
healthcare.
Both the Health and the Judiciary
Committees have advanced legislative
packages that help address drug prices,
including bills I have sponsored, such
as the CREATES Act, the Stop
STALLING Act, and the Prescription
Pricing for the People Act.
Since January, the Finance Com-
mittee, which I chair, and Senator
WYDEN is the ranking member, has
held a series of hearings to examine the
vulnerabilities in the drug supply chain
that are ripe for abuse. We don’t have
the answers to all the problems, but it
is really crystal clear that a strong
dose of transparency is desperately
needed to shed light on a convoluted
pricing system when dealing with pre-
scription drugs.
From the drug manufacturer to the
patient’s medicine cabinet, the drug
supply chain is shrouded in secrecy and
is exceedingly complex. This opaque
pricing system has allowed exorbitant
price hikes to climb higher and higher
and higher, with no end in sight.
Don’t forget, the taxpayers of the
United States foot the bill for the
lion’s share of prescription drugs
through Medicare and Medicaid.
The woolly drug supply chain allows
taxpayers to be fleeced year after year.
We need to let the sunshine in to help
root out their abusive practices. Se-
crecy in the supply chain has grown
into a noxious weed, damaging our free
market ecosystem.
Transparency is needed to help rein
in unsustainable costs threatening the
fiscal viability of Medicaid and Medi-
care. Seniors, individuals with dis-
ability, and low-income Americans de-
pend on these programs for lifesaving
medicine and innovative cures.
Last week, the Senate Finance Com-
mittee approved the bipartisan Pre-
scription Drug Price Reduction Act.
The carefully sown Grassley-Wyden bill
limits seniors’ out-of-pocket costs
without limiting access to lifesaving
cures Americans expect. It injects rea-
sonable incentives in government pre-
scription drug programs for drug man-
ufacturers and insurers to keep prices
low. Pharmaceutical companies and in-
surers need to have more skin in the
game to keep prices down. It also fixes
flawed policies that distort free market
principles to lower the lid on spending.
We all know in the town meetings
and other places we go that Americans
have spoken very loudly on this sub-
ject. They want high prescription drug
prices addressed. Furthermore, Ameri-
cans want Congress to act and to act
now.
The Senate Finance, HELP, and Ju-
diciary Committees have acted. Now it
is time to get the job done.
As my fellow lawmakers go home
over the August recess, I encourage
each of you to share the good news
with your constituents. Americans are
fed up with sticker shock at the phar-
macy counter. We have the oppor-
tunity to deliver a badly needed legis-
lative remedy.
First, we have to drain the swampy
special interests blocking the path to
victory. The moneyed players in the
drug supply chain will use the August
recess to unleash a public relations
blitz against our bipartisan efforts.
You can bet the farm that Big Pharma,
hospitals, and pharmacy benefit man-
agers will whip themselves into a real
frenzy to kill these bipartisan reforms.
Let’s remember why we started down
this path in the first place. It is simply
democracy working, representative
government working.
Americans are demanding relief at
the prescription counter. We hear it
from our constituents in our town
meetings, in our letters, in our emails,
and in the phone calls we get. Un-
checked drug prices are putting Medi-
care and Medicaid in financial peril.
The payment structure is unmoored
from fiscal reality, and the American
taxpayer is on the hook. Congress has a
real opportunity to do something about
the spiraling of drug prices.
For my colleagues who are on the
fence about our bipartisan proposal—
and there is nothing wrong with being
on the fence because you have plenty of
time to become acquainted with an
issue you hear from your constituents
all the time and to become acquainted
with our solution—here are a series of
questions I want you to ask yourself:
Do Americans want us to act to reduce
runaway drug prices? Do Americans
want to keep access to breakthrough
drug therapies and innovation? Do
older Americans want protection from
coverage gaps and out-of-pocket costs?
Do people with disabilities and poor
and elderly Americans who depend on
Medicaid deserve access to innovative
cures and next-generation therapies?
The answer to all of these questions,
I think, is a resounding yes.
Farmers are smart enough to make
hay while the Sun shines. Let’s apply
that time-tested farm lesson in the
Congress. Don’t bail out on the oppor-
tunity to make a meaningful difference
for the people whom we are elected to
serve. Too many Americans are ration-
ing or skipping doses because they
can’t afford their prescription medi-
cines.
I will finish as I started out by say-
ing, on behalf of Senator WYDEN, Sen-
ator ALEXANDER, Senator MURRAY,
Senator GRAHAM, Senator FEINSTEIN,
and others, I suggest to our colleagues
that this is our Goldilocks moment.
Let’s not let it be a gridlock moment.
Our legislative reforms are not too far
right and not too far left. That is what
makes our bipartisan remedy to lower
prescription drug prices just exactly
right for the American people.
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF KELLY CRAFT
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I
rise in opposition to the nomination of
Ms. Kelly Craft to serve as the next
U.S. Ambassador to the United Na-
tions.
As a firm believer in the strength and
power of U.S. diplomacy, there are
three main reasons I oppose Ambas-
sador Craft’s nomination.
First and foremost, she lacks the ex-
perience necessary to stand up for
American values and promote our na-
tional security on the global stage.
Second, during her brief diplomatic
tenure in Canada, she posted so many
absences that I cannot describe it as
anything less than a dereliction of
duty.
Ambassador Craft has also been un-
able or unwilling to convince the Sen-
ate that she will fully separate her pro-
fessional obligations from her family’s
business interests. We cannot have an
ambassador to the United Nations who
risks using this incredibly influential
position in ways that could benefit her
own family’s finances.
This position is one of the most im-
portant diplomatic posts in our govern-
ment. It is a global stage, and every
leader who serves in this role must al-
ways put country first.
Since its founding, some of our most
distinguished public servants have rep-
resented the United States at the U.N.:
George H. W. Bush, Jeane Kirkpatrick,
Thomas Pickering, Madeleine Albright,
John Negroponte, Susan Rice, and
Samantha Power.
These Americans brought to the
table years of experience as former
Ambassadors, senior State Department
officials, National Security Council
staff, and more. Ambassador Craft sim-
ply cannot match the foreign policy
and national security expertise offered
by these distinguished leaders.
Before serving as the U.S. Ambas-
sador to Canada, she had no previous
significant foreign policy experience or
executive experience at all. It would
seem that her most relevant credential
is that she, along with her husband,
contributed more than $1 million to
the President’s campaign.
During the confirmation process,
Ambassador Craft’s performance sug-
gested a deep lack of knowledge and
applicable experience.
I want to be clear. This is not a judg-
ment on her character. This is merely
an assessment of her ability to rep-
resent the United States of America on
the world stage where she will grapple
with some of the most complex and
challenging foreign policy issues of our
time.
When asked at her hearing to iden-
tify the most pressing issues facing the
U.N. and comment on how the United
States could leverage the U.N. to pur-
sue our national foreign policy prior-
ities, Craft displayed no sophisticated
understanding of the many challenges
confronting our country.
She failed to mention North Korea’s
aggression on nuclear proliferation.
She failed to mention ongoing threats
from Iran. She failed to mention Chi-
na’s growing power and Russia’s con-
tinued malign influence. When asked
about the two-state solution, she could
not articulate a viewpoint. When asked
by Senator PAUL whether she believed
the Iraq war was a mistake, she replied
that she was ‘‘not going to second
guess the . . . Bush administration.’’
In response to Senator CARDIN’s ques-
tion about the threat of climate
change, she said that the United States
does not need to be a member of the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5183
July 30, 2019
Paris climate agreement in order to
show leadership. All the more dis-
turbing are her past comments on cli-
mate change, such as when she said, ‘‘I
believe there are scientists on both
sides that are accurate.’’
Taken together, these answers should
alarm anyone who hopes that the
United States can use our power, our
influence, and our leadership position
to promote our interests and answer
the great challenges of our time. Sim-
ply put, never in our Nation’s history
has a President nominated such an
underqualified person to this critical
post just for being a donor.
Ms. Craft also lacks the profes-
sionalism needed to be the U.N. Ambas-
sador. As our Ambassador to Canada,
she had one job: to represent the
United States in Canada. Yet, during
her time in Ottawa, the defining char-
acteristic of her service appears to be
how little time she actually spent
there.
The numbers speak for themselves.
During the 608 days she served as
U.S. Ambassador in Ottawa, she spent
357 days outside of Canada. Let me re-
peat that. During her 21 months as-
signed to Ottawa, she spent an entire
year out of Canada.
For my colleagues who insist she was
engaged in trade negotiations, the
State Department’s own records sug-
gest otherwise. Indeed, the record
shows she spent only 40 days on travel
related to USMCA. She did, however,
spend 210 days at her homes in Ken-
tucky or Oklahoma. I repeat, she spent
7 of her 21 months as our Ambassador
in Canada at home in the United
States. The last time I checked, not a
single round of the USMCA negotia-
tions took place in Kentucky or Okla-
homa.
Additionally, while Ms. Craft claims
that she always received approval from
her travel, records show that she spent
at least 11 days out of the country
without State Department approval.
Should she be confirmed as Ambas-
sador of the U.N., I think it is very fair
to say that if an international crisis
erupts, we might more likely find her
in Kentucky than New York City.
Ambassador Craft’s absences rep-
resent a total abdication of her respon-
sibility as the head of the U.S. Em-
bassy in Canada—one of our Nation’s
most vital allies.
In one troubling instance, during the
month when the Trump administration
shut down the Federal Government,
Ambassador Craft was in Ottawa for
only 2 days. Rather than provide lead-
ership to Embassy personnel during un-
certain times, she was at home in Ken-
tucky. Perhaps she thought she was
nonessential personnel.
Finally, Ms. Craft has also displayed
a lack of diligence when it comes to
preventing conflicts of interest. I know
this administration has sunk to some
new lows when it comes to mixing fam-
ily business with national security, but
that doesn’t mean it is OK. Norms are
only as strong as our will to stand up
and defend them. That is why we must
push back against self-promotion at
the expense of the American people.
We also know that Ambassador
Craft’s husband, Joe Craft, runs the
second largest coal producer in the
Eastern United States and has lobbied
the EPA to roll back regulations
against air and water pollution. Ms.
Craft insisted to the committee that
her husband ‘‘plays no role whatsoever
in official U.S. government business,’’
but email and calendar records tell a
different story. When Ambassador
Craft needed information about a U.S.
environmental project, she asked her
husband—not Embassy employees—to
connect her to former EPA Adminis-
trator Scott Pruitt. When the EPA
sent the requested information to the
Ambassador, they included her spouse
on the response. In addition, according
to official calendars, Mr. Craft partici-
pated in at least four meetings with
U.S. or Canadian Government energy
and environmental officials. The poten-
tial conflicts of interest are staggering.
The nomination of Ms. Craft to this
position underscores the Trump admin-
istration’s total lack of respect for the
work of diplomacy, for our diplomats,
and for the United Nations.
Taken together, Ambassador Craft’s
lack of experience, her dereliction of
duty and excessive absences in Ottawa,
and her unwillingness to address poten-
tial conflicts of interest render her
unfit to serve as our Ambassador to the
United Nations.
In a world of growing challenges, the
American people deserve a serious,
thoughtful, and proven leader to rep-
resent their interests at the United Na-
tions. They deserve a leader who can
leverage the United Nations to advance
our national security interests and ul-
timately build a safer, more stable,
prosperous world. They deserve a lead-
er who will put the interests of the peo-
ple over the profits of their family.
Kelly Knight Craft is not that leader.
For those reasons, I will vote no on
this nomination and urge my col-
leagues to join me.

TRIBUTE TO KATHRYN WEEDEN
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
today I join my friend the majority
leader in offering a heartfelt thank
you, congratulations, and happy retire-
ment to the principal of the Senate
Page School, Ms. Kathryn Weeden. She
leaves the Senate and the Page School
after 26 years of illustrious service. In
that time, she has transformed the
lives of countless young men and
women interested in the workings of
government.
The Senate Page School is an institu-
tion unlike any other on Capitol Hill
and very different from most schools in
America. Every semester, some of the
most accomplished young men and
women come to Washington from
across the country to learn about our
government. In short order, they are
thrown into a routine that includes
classes early in the morning, classes
late into the night, and a full-time job
in the Senate in between. When you
consider the additional demands of
homework, getting acclimated to a new
city, and new peers, you realize just
how important it is for these young
men and women to have someone they
can trust, rely on, and go to for support
and guidance. For the last 26 years,
that person has been Ms. Weeden. With
her at the helm, I have always had con-
fidence that the Senate’s pages were
getting the learning experience of their
lives.
For the minds she has inspired, for
the institution she has shaped, and for
the Nation she has served, I want to
say thank you and my best wishes to
Ms. Weeden. May others follow in the
example of selflessness and civic duty
that she has gracefully set.
f
TRIBUTE TO SABRA FIELD
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, over
a storied 50-year career, Sabra Field
has established herself as a great
Vermont artist. Her works have made
hers a unique and highly sought-after
brand, one which beautifully depicts
Vermont’s landscape. Her prints, made
by hand using woodblocks, are a pre-
mier example of how Vermonters har-
bor a deep commitment to creating and
providing high-quality goods, made
with passion. Her work has promoted
Vermont, and I could not be more
proud to recognize this acclaimed art-
ist.
Sabra enrolled at Middlebury College
in 1953, where she was inspired by Piero
della Francesca’s painting ‘‘The Flag-
ellation of Christ.’’ One of her instruc-
tors instilled a belief within her that,
in her words, made art ‘‘seem like a
noble calling.’’ Sabra has followed this
calling over the last 50-years, creating
beautiful works of art that portray
Vermont’s landscapes. Born in Okla-
homa and raised in neighboring New
York, Sabra believes that her profes-
sional career began when she moved to
Vermont. She recalled in a Vermont
Digger article that ‘‘Vermont was
beautiful and Vermonters unpre-
tentious, generous, and understood
‘home occupation.’ I was free to be
me.’’ This environment made Vermont
an ideal work and home location for
Sabra.
Sabra’s achievements are impressive.
Her work has been featured on the
cover of Vermont Life magazine. It is
showcased in a stained glass window at
Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center
in New Hampshire. It has been printed
on 250,000 UNICEF Cards. And Sabra’s
work was featured on 60 million post-
age stamps commemorating Vermont’s
1991 bicentennial. Sabra’s work has
gained popularity far and wide over the
last five decades. Marcelle and I have
several of her prints in our home as
well.
I am proud to recognize the contribu-
tion and achievements that Sabra has
made over her 50 years in Vermont. I
ask unanimous consent to have printed
in the RECORD a Vermont Digger arti-
cle titled ‘‘Sabra Field marks 50th year
making Vermont Art.’’ It describes the
hard work that goes into making each
piece of art and highlights Field’s com-
mitment to capturing Vermont’s pic-
turesque landscape.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:

SABRA FIELD MARKS 50TH YEAR MAKING
VERMONT ART
(By Kevin O’Connor)
EAST BARNARD.—Sabra Field recalls the
moment a half-century ago when she made
her first woodblock print in Vermont.
‘‘No one said I couldn’t,’’ she says, ‘‘and I
was too naive to realize the odds.’’
The Oklahoma-born and New York-raised
artist didn’t know her ink-on-paper images
of red barns, green hills and blue skies would
land on the cover of Vermont Life magazine,
an annual namesake calendar, a stained
glass window at neighboring New Hamp-
shire’s Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Cen-
ter, 250,000 UNICEF cards and 60 million
postage stamps commemorating Vermont’s
1991 bicentennial.
This coming weekend, the 84-year-old
printmaker will celebrate her 50th year mak-
ing iconic Vermont art.
‘‘When people ask what piece means the
most to me,’’ she says, ‘‘I answer, ‘The one
I’m going to do next.’ ’’
Field’s Green Mountain story began in 1953
when she enrolled at Middlebury College
(‘‘there was no math requirement,’’ she ex-
plains) and had an epiphany while studying
Piero della Francesca’s 1450s painting ‘‘The
Flagellation of Christ.’’
‘‘I saw that great art is composed from
what we see,’’ she recalls, ‘‘but it is not a
replica of what we see.’’
Field’s watercolor teacher made art ‘‘seem
like a noble calling.’’ But she yearned less
for a brush than for woodblocks, which she
discovered upon further schooling at Con-
necticut’s Wesleyan University.
‘‘Prints are for everybody,’’ she says of the
easily reproducible medium. ‘‘I wanted to
spend all my time making images and I was
willing to take the risk. I felt, in a sense,
that I had no choice.’’
‘‘Over the course of her career she has re-
ceived any number of accolades, and has
been variously described as ‘the Grant Wood
of Vermont,’ ‘the artist laureate of
Vermont,’ and as someone who ‘has touched
more lives than any Vermont artist in his-
tory,’ ’’ Richard Saunders, a Middlebury Col-
lege professor and director of its Museum of
Art, wrote in the catalogue of the 2017 retro-
spective ‘‘Sabra Field, Then and Now.’’

Yet every peak in this artist’s world is
framed by valleys. The mother of two young
sons moved from Connecticut to a former
19th-century tavern in the White River val-
ley village of East Barnard after her first
marriage ended in 1969.
‘‘When I arrived, people were unsure,’’ she
recalls. ‘‘Is she just here for the summer?’’
Field soon contacted the secretary of
state’s office to register a printmaking busi-
ness.
‘‘Somehow I knew I wanted the legitimacy
of being validated.’’
Tallying initial sales on her children’s toy
cash register, Field began to design, draw
and cut the woodblock images that have sus-
tained her ever since.
‘‘My life as a professional artist really
didn’t begin until I moved,’’ she says.
‘‘Vermont was beautiful and Vermonters un-
pretentious, generous, and understood ‘home
occupation.’ I was free to be me.’’
Field soon met her second husband, Spen-
cer, who became her business manager. But
her work wasn’t always seen as marketable.
Take the story behind her 1977 four-print
‘‘Mountain Suite.’’
‘‘Vermont Life requested a seasonal suite
to sell,’’ she recalls. ‘‘Then they declined to
buy them.’’
The artist went on to distribute the images
herself. The magazine has since folded. But
log onto her website and you’ll see the
passed-over prints remain in circulation for
$250 each.
Field’s resulting career has been chron-
icled in two books—2002’s ‘‘The Art of Place’’
and 2004’s ‘‘In Sight’’—and the 2015 documen-
tary ‘‘Sabra.’’ Middlebury College, for its
part, has an archive copy of every one of her
prints.
Field can share stories of private struggle
as well as of professional success. She re-
winds back five decades to inking her first
works.
‘‘I hung them outside to dry.’’
The wind wasn’t the only thing that got
carried away that day.
Field has weathered bigger changes rang-
ing from the advent of new reproduction
technology for the prints she continues to
create by hand to the 2010 death of her hus-
band. Now assisted by fellow printmaker and
neighbor Jeanne Amato, she still works with
woodblocks, be it for a recent children’s
book ‘‘Where Do They Go?’’ with Addison
County writer Julia Alvarez or a coming
nine-piece suite of prints she conceived after
President Donald Trump’s election.
‘‘I decided we needed to look at it as a
challenge and we couldn’t let him manipu-
late our emotions,’’ she says of the Trump-
inspired prints. As for exactly what they pic-
ture, she adds only: ‘‘They will be somewhat
mysterious. But when you get it, you get it.’’
Field is marking her 50th year in Vermont
with a special poster and open house at her
East Barnard studio July 13 and 14 from 10
a.m. to 5 p.m., with more information avail-
able on her website.
‘‘The career highs that sustain me are not
glamorous by the standards of the wider
world, but they confirm that I made the
right decision and that this wonderful place
is home,’’ she says. ‘‘I’ve never fallen out of
love with my medium. I couldn’t be happy
otherwise.’’

RECOGNIZING WHITE RIVER JUNC-
TION FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, White
River Junction, VT, has seen a renais-
sance over the last 20 years. Led by a
band of female entrepreneurs, this vil-
lage tucked along the Connecticut
River is today the home of dozens of
thriving businesses. No fewer than 25 of
these business are run by women, and
together they are the core of a vibrant,
growing community.
Kim Souza, the owner of the consign-
ment store Revolution, was one of the
first business owners to move back to
White River Junction. The first few
years were tough, but with the support
of her community, Revolution found
its footing. Soon more businesses
opened, and new life was breathed into
the town.
Across the street, Julie Sumanis and
Elenda Taylor opened JUEL, a juice
bar and café, in the ground floor of a
new apartment building. In 2008, Leslie
Carleton moved from nearby Norwich
to open Upper Valley Yoga. Seven
years later, Kate Gamble opened Open
Door, another yoga studio.
The successes of these businesses did
not come without challenges and dif-
ficulties, but their successes showcase
the power of bold ideas, commitment,
dedication, and, ultimately, commu-
nity. In 2007, Kim thought Revolution
would have to close its doors, until she
found the backing of a local mother
and daughter that allowed her to stay
open. Catherine Doherty, the producing
director of White River’s Northern
Stage theatre company, credits the
community’s support for keeping the
company alive through challenging
times.
Today, White River Junction has be-
come a destination and a cultural cen-
ter of the region. The surge of develop-
ment brought on by pioneers like Kim
continues to bring new people into the
town, some feeling empowered to start
businesses of their own, to shape their
futures, and to make the community
stronger. This is the very heart of the
American dream. The future of
Vermont rests with entrepreneurs
across the State, and I am glad to see
it in such capable hands.
I am proud to recognize the achieve-
ments of these women and the con-
tributions they have made to the town
of White River Junction and their
broader communities. I ask unanimous
consent to enter into the RECORD a
Boston Globe article titled ‘‘In White
River Junction, sisters are doing it for
themselves.’’ It describes their suc-
cesses and the challenges they over-
came in helping to revive their town.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:

IN WHITE RIVER JUNCTION, SISTERS ARE DOING
IT FOR THEMSELVES
(By Kevin Cullen)
WHITE RIVER JUNCTION, VT.—Kim Souza
opened her consignment and thrift clothing
store here in 2002, when this old, wheezy vil-
lage hard by the New Hampshire border was
so deserted you half-expected to see
tumbleweeds rolling down North Main
Street.
She let the locals know that beyond selling
new clothing, she would also sell used stuff
and offered to buy gently used clothes from
them.
Dancers at The Wrap, a strip joint directly
across the street from Souza’s shop, began
showing up regularly with outrageously high
platform shoes and audacious, skimpy out-
fits. Souza had to wave them off when the
strippers tried to sell her their thongs.
‘‘I had to draw the line somewhere,’’ Souza
said, standing behind the counter of her
store next to an elaborate cappucino ma-
chine.
The Wrap burned to the ground years ago,
and in its place has risen, phoenix-like, a
modern apartment building, the anchor of
which is a ground-level cafe, apothecary, and
juice bar called JUEL, after its owners, Julie
Sumanis and Elena Taylor.
The cafe, located on the corner of North
Main and Bridge streets, in the heart of
downtown, captures the essence of the ren-
aissance of this old industrial village: On the
same spot where women were once exploited
and objectified, two young female entre-
preneurs are running a thriving business.
Souza, White River’s pioneering business-
woman, recently did some research and fig-
ured out that no less than 25 businesses that
have opened in the once-vacant and newly
built storefronts in the four-block downtown
area are run by women.
It wasn’t planned. It isn’t part of some
high-minded government-incentive program.
It just happened. Organically.
Souza was working at a travel agency in
New Hampshire when a mentor, Murray
Washburn, suggested she start a business in
gritty White River, which is sandwiched in
the Upper Valley between the more genteel
locales of Hanover in New Hampshire and
Woodstock in Vermont.
Souza went for it, opening a funky cloth-
ing store in what had been a frame shop for
30 years and called it Revolution, which was
prescient because she started one.
Things were slow at first. After four years,
Souza thought she would have to go out of
business. A local woman, Ann Johnston, and
her then-teenage daughter, Simran, loved
the store and were crestfallen when Souza
told them she was going to close up.
‘‘What would it take to keep Revolution
open?’’ Ann Johnston asked.
The answer was financial backing, which
Johnston and her daughter provided, giving
new, sustained life to Revolution, and the
revolution of female businesses.
Souza said Leslie Carleton’s decision to
open Upper Valley Yoga on North Main
Street in 2008 was a pivotal moment.
Carleton’s previous studio was in Norwich, a
nearby, more upscale town. Many of
Carleton’s well-heeled students followed her,
with some trepidation, to White River.
Those mostly female yogis discovered
something that Souza has immortalized on a
T-shirt she sells, emblazoned with the words,
‘‘White River Junction’’ on the front, and, on
the back, ‘‘It’s not so bad.’’
‘‘When I came to White River Junction,’’
Carleton said, sitting at a table outside
JUEL, ‘‘it was still pretty rough. It was dead
on a Sunday morning. The sleazy strip club
was still there. The ATM at the strip club
dispensed only $1 and $5 bills.’’
But Carleton hung in there, and other yoga
studios have followed.
Four years ago, Kate Gamble, a physical
therapist, opened Open Door, a one-stop
wellness center, offering services including
yoga, physical therapy, acupuncture, and
Chinese medicine. At something she hosts
called The Death Cafe, a hospice nurse helps
people ‘‘be more comfortable about end of
life issues,’’ Gamble said.
‘‘This place reminds me of Brooklyn,’’
Gamble said. ‘‘It was a dump, but a lot of
people with energy and new ideas have
moved in and changed things.’’
Carleton harbors a nagging worry that it
might become too much like Brooklyn, with
rents soaring and inventory drying up.

S5186 July 30, 2019
But given what White River Junction
looked like and felt like not so long ago, the
pros seem to far outweigh the cons, and offi-
cials in the town of Hartford, where White
River is located, are thrilled with all the new
businesses and tax revenue.
And as freight trains roll through the
downtown regularly, blowing their horns,
White River is not in danger of becoming
precious or pretentious any time soon. It re-
tains a chunk of its old grittiness.
Taylor, 37, and Sumanis, 31, became fast
friends when they worked as waitresses at
Elixir, an upscale restaurant here. They had
a shared interest in wellness, herbalism, and
eating healthy. More importantly, their
bosses, Skip Symanski and Jane Carrier, had
set an example.
When Symanski and Carrier opened a high-
end restaurant here 10 years ago, people
thought they were nuts. But Taylor and
Sumanis learned that if you build a quality
business, the people will come. It gave them
the gumption to strike out on their own.
Three years ago, they started with a food
truck. When space became available in a new
building, they went all in.
‘‘Elixir paved the way for a lot of us,’’
Sumanis said.
They also point to Souza as a nurturing
maternal figure to younger entrepreneurs.
Souza gives credit to the male developers
who remade the town’s footprint, but agrees
there is a mutually supportive business cli-
mate that has an especially feminine side to
it.
‘‘Women are by nature nurturing,’’ she
said. ‘‘There is a lot of mutual support and
encouragement going on here.’’
Given that they both offer yoga classes,
Carleton and Gamble are technically com-
petitors. But they routinely send customers
to each other’s business, depending on what
those customers want and need.
‘‘Everybody has each other’s back,’’ said
Taylor, who has given spare keys for JUEL
to Gamble and Souza, whose businesses are
right across North Main.
There are downsides to all this progress
and prosperity. You used to be able to park
an aircraft carrier along North Main Street.
Now they limit free parking to two hours be-
tween 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., from Monday to Sat-
urday. Things can get tight, especially on
weekends.
And, this being Vermont, there are some
who decry what they dismiss as
gentrification.
A local blogger, Rejjie Carter, bemoaned
what he calls the colonization of White River
Junction, writing that the land where it sits
belonged to the Abenaki tribe before settlers
showed up, and that landlords are now cash-
ing in and driving out poorer residents.
‘‘Colonialism, capitalism, and private
property are the enemies,’’ Carter wrote.
Like I said, this is Vermont.
Souza, who is a town selectboard member
and committed to many social justice
causes, bristles at characterizing what has
happened here as gentrification.
‘‘When women are opening businesses in a
defunct town, it’s less about money and
power and more about care and community,’’
she said. ‘‘Gentrification happens when peo-
ple are displaced. There were no people in
White River Junction when developers like
Matt Bucy, Mike Davidson, and Bill
Bittinger came along. Almost every single
one of the old empty buildings they rehabbed
or the new buildings they erected in vacant
lots added affordable living space to our
community.’’
Two months ago, a teacher from the Hart-
ford public schools brought a bunch of stu-
dents on a field trip to visit some of the fe-
male-run businesses.
‘‘It was a joy to listen to so many of the
young girls ask questions about how to start
a business,’’ said Souza. ‘‘It felt like some-
thing was happening.’’

RECOGNIZING VERMONT’S
MAGICIANS WITHOUT BORDERS
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, when
Lincoln, VT, resident Tom Verner per-
forms magic shows for children in ref-
ugee camps, orphanages, and hospitals,
he brings joy and laughter to the
places where it is most needed. In 2002,
Tom and his wife, Janet Fredericks, co-
founded Magicians Without Borders
and have since performed in more than
40 countries, for more than 1,000,000 of
the world’s most vulnerable people.
Magicians Without Borders is one shin-
ing example of Vermonters thinking
outside the box and using their cre-
ativity to make the world a better
place. It is with pride and appreciation
that I recognize Tom, Janet and the
Magicians Without Borders organiza-
tion for their achievements.
Tom was a professor of psychology in
2001 when he embarked on a trip
through the Balkans, performing magic
shows in the refugee camps of Kosovo
and Macedonia. The performances were
so well received that, upon returning
to Vermont, Tom took a year off from
his position at Burlington College to
found Magicians Without Borders.
Since Tom’s first trip, he and Janet
have made six trips each year, con-
tinuing to use magic to transform the
lives of youth in at risk situations
around the globe. Tom, Janet, and Ma-
gicians Without Borders have per-
formed everywhere from the Sudan, to
Colombia, from Ukraine to Bangladesh.
They traveled to Thailand and Burma
for a month of performances in the
wake of a tsunami and performed
stateside throughout Alabama, Mis-
sissippi, and Louisiana after Hurricane
Katrina.
In 2004, a series of shows at rural
schools in El Salvador was met with
such positivity that Tom was asked to
teach a few magic tricks to the stu-
dents. These impromptu classes turned
into a unique, long-term education pro-
gram geared toward increasing self-
confidence, discipline, focus, and self-
esteem. Tom, Janet, and Magicians
Without Borders have now returned to
El Salvador more than 30 times to en-
tertain and educate these children who
find themselves surrounded by terrible
gang violence and abject poverty. The
program has inspired young Salva-
doran magicians to perform their own
magic shows in orphanages, hospitals,
and disaster areas and aspire to teach
magic to other young people.
Due to their success in El Salvador,
Magicians Without Borders expanded
these education programs to Brazil, Co-
lombia, Costa Rica, and the United
States. Two additional education pro-
grams have been implemented in India.
I am proud to recognize the contribu-
tions that Tom, Janet, and Magicians
Without Borders have made me so
many communities across globe in the
last 18 years. I ask unanimous consent
to have printed in the RECORD an
Addison Independent article titled
‘‘Lincoln Magicians Bring Joy to Refu-
gees at the Border.’’ It describes how
Tom and Janet use magic to connect
with those suffering at our southern
border and how they have expanded
their mission to entertain, educate and
empower across the world.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

LINCOLN MAGICIANS BRING JOY TO REFUGEES
AT THE BORDER
LINCOLN.—Tom Verner and Janet Fred-
ericks performed magic at the U.S.-Mexico
border last December.
Not the kind of magic that allows tired,
hungry and fearful refugees to simply waltz
across the border to new lives in America.
The Lincoln couple, working as Magicians
Without Borders, staged a show of sleights-
of-hand and humor designed to not only en-
tertain, but also to provide a light of hope in
dark circumstances.
Since that December trip, U.S. Customs
and Border Protection has encountered more
than half a million additional migrants hop-
ing to enter the U.S. The vast majority of
these refugees were arrested and detained by
Immigration and Customs Enforcement
(ICE) in facilities that a growing number of
experts, including Holocaust scholars, have
compared to concentration camps.
Performing at the border last year, and
again this past March, has helped Verner and
Fredericks better understand the issues
there.
‘‘These refugees didn’t want to leave their
homes,’’ Verner told the Independent this
week. ‘‘They’re fleeing murderous violence,
political oppression and grinding poverty,
and they’re coming to the closest place
where, as the Statue of Liberty says, they
can ‘breathe free.’ ’’
During their March trip, Verner and Fred-
ericks met a six-year-old boy named Sebas-
tian, whose family had fled Honduras. Be-
cause Sebastian has cerebral palsy and can-
not walk, his father had carried him on his
back—for more than 1,800 miles.
The conditions and political climate of the
U.S. border are nothing, however, compared
with those in Honduras, Sebastian’s father
told Verner.
It’s the kind of story the Lincoln residents
have encountered over and over again—all
over the world.
Since founding Magicians Without Borders
in 2002, Verner and Fredericks have traveled
to more than 40 countries and performed for
‘‘over 1 million of the most forgotten people
in the world.’’
Their mission is to entertain, educate and
empower.
BEGINNINGS
In 2001 Verner, then a professor of psy-
chology at Burlington College, was traveling
through the Balkans, performing magic
shows in refugee camps in Kosovo and Mac-
edonia.
‘‘It was a transformative experience,’’ he
said.
In one Macedonian camp, which sheltered
about 2,000 people, mostly Roma, Verner met
a little girl named Fatima who became his
‘‘assistant’’ for the day.
‘‘We couldn’t understand each other’s lan-
guages, but we understood each other,’’
Verner said. When it came time for Verner to
move on to the next camp, however, he could
not find Fatima to say good-bye. Dis-
appointed, he returned to his car, only to
find Fatima hiding in the back seat. She

begged Verner to take her with him, but he
could not.
Verner’s driver then suggested they visit
Shutka, Macedonia, which the driver said
was ‘‘swollen with refugees.’’ Within 10 min-
utes of their arrival in the main square more
than 300 people had gathered to watch him
perform, Verner said.
Afterward, he recalled, ‘‘a Roma woman
who’d seen me multiplying things in my
show, came up to me holding a five-dinari
Macedonian coin. ‘Make more money,’ she
said. She thought if I could make things
multiply, why not money?’’
Verner performed a trick producing a 50–
dinari coin—the equivalent of about 80 cents
at the time—and the woman was genuinely
thrilled.
After she walked away, two Roma men
who’d been watching asked Verner if he
could produce visas to America.
‘‘They were completely serious,’’ Verner
said. ‘‘As if I could wave a magic wand and
Condoleezza Rice would suddenly sign the
necessary paperwork.’’
These and other encounters led to an
epiphany for Verner, which he distills into a
quote from fellow magician Harry Houdini—
himself a refugee from Hungary:
‘‘In certain circumstances, magic not only
amazes and amuses but it has the power to
awaken hope that the impossible is pos-
sible.’’
Upon his return to Vermont, Verner ob-
tained a year’s leave from Burlington Col-
lege to found Magicians Without Borders.
‘‘That one year has turned into 18,’’ he said
happily.
TEACHING MAGIC
In 2004, Magicians Without Borders
(MWB) visited El Salvador, which was still
reeling in the aftermath of a 12–year civil
war that had been fought in large part by
child soldiers.
The founder-director of the Salvadoran
Rural Health Association was so impressed
with Verner’s school performances that she
asked him to teach some magic tricks to
children participating in a program called
‘‘Barefoot Angels’’ (so named because many
of the children had been working barefoot in
a garbage dump). Verner readily agreed.
At the end of that daylong workshop, one
of the students, 14–year-old Jaime Zumba,
asked, ‘‘When are you coming back?’’
Verner, who had had no return plans, hesi-
tated, then said, ‘‘How about May?’’
That moment, Verner said, changed the
course of MWB. Since then he’s visited El
Salvador more than 30 times.
Soon, some of the children wanted to do
more than just learn a few magic tricks.
They were aspiring to teach it to other chil-
dren. As a result, MWB now has programs in
Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador and Costa
Rica.
Two more programs have evolved in India,
as well—one at a night-care shelter for the
children of brothel workers who are trapped
in the sex trade.
‘‘These were children who had been sleep-
ing under mom’s bed while she was work-
ing,’’ Verner recalled soberly.
That program’s Hindi name, Prerana,
translates into English as ‘‘Inspiration.’’
DREAMS
‘‘We’re not trying to teach them to be ma-
gicians,’’ Verner said. ‘‘We’re trying to build
their confidence in themselves. What hap-
pens is that these kids start studying and
performing, and something starts to happen,
you start to see all these benefits. It
awakens dreams.’’
Verner spoke of children who’ve gone on to
pursue studies in nursing, culinary arts and
social work.
None of this would have been possible,
however, without the generous support
Verner and Fredericks have received over
the years, both abroad and at home.
In the coming weeks, for instance, allies of
MWB have scheduled two fundraising events
at Bixby Library in Vergennes, which they
hope will help fund another trip to the U.S.-
Mexico border in August.
Magicians Without Borders will perform
for children at the Bixby on July 25, from
6:30 to 8 p.m., then give a brief talk about
their work.
An event on Aug. 1, from 7 to 8:30 p.m., will
be geared toward adults: travel stories and
performance history, with some magic woven
in.
Verner hopes MWB can make multiple
trips to the border in the future, in part be-
cause he knows what’s at stake. After all,
even his own sources of hope and inspiration
have emerged from deeply, shockingly tragic
circumstances.
Jaime Zumba’s enthusiasm in El Salvador
15 years ago may have changed the course of
MWB, but the young man’s lived experience,
like that of so many thousands who have fled
their homes, is all too familiar in that part
of the world and often inspires too little no-
tice.
‘‘It is not uncommon,’’ he once told
Verner, ‘‘for me to walk over a decapitated
naked body on my way to school.’’

POLICY JUSTIFICATION
Canada—Multifunctional Information Dis-
tribution System (MIDS)—Joint Tactical
Radio System (JTRS)(5)
The Government of Canada has requested
to buy one hundred fifty-two (152) MIDS
JTRS (5) with Remote Power Supply. Also
included are spare cables and MIDS bat-
teries; Link–16 mobile racks; diagnostic sup-
port tools; technical documentation; train-
ing and engineering technical support; and
other related elements of logistics and pro-
gram support. The total estimated program
cost is $44 million.
This proposed sale will support the foreign
policy and national security objectives of
the United States by helping to improve the
military capability of Canada, a NATO ally
that is an important force for ensuring polit-
ical stability and economic progress and a
contributor to military, peacekeeping and
humanitarian operations around the world.
Canada intends to upgrade its current in-
ventory of CF–18 Aircraft, CC–130J, and the
Royal Canadian Air Force’s Ground Stations
with the purchase of these MIDS JTRS (5)
terminals to be fully interoperable with U.S.
and allied forces to support and compliment
joint operations in a net-enabled environ-
ment; have modernized electronic protection
and secure, jam-resistant wave forms; and be
capable of improved Link–16 message ex-
change and information fidelity including
support to advanced weapon employment.
Canada will have no difficulty absorbing this
equipment into its armed forces.
The proposed sale of this equipment and
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region.
The principal contractors for MIDS JTRS
are Viasat, Incorporated, headquartered in
Carlsbad, CA and Data Link Solutions,
headquartered in Cedar Rapids, IA. The Gov-
ernment of Canada is expected to negotiate
an offset agreement with the principal con-
tractor(s), in accordance with Canada’s In-
dustrial and Technological Benefits (ITB)
Policy, before signing the Letter of Offer and
Acceptance (LOA), but details are not known
at this time.
Implementation of this proposed sale will
not require the assignment of additional U.S.

(vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
1. The Multifunctional Information Dis-
tribution System (MIDS) Joint Tactical
Radio (JTRS) is a software defined radio.
The MIDS JTRS Programmable Secure In-
formation Security Architecture Module
(PSISAM) is Critical Program Information
(CPI). The PSISAM is embedded in a MIDS
JTRS Shop Replaceable Unit (SRU) and con-
tains the information security hardware and
cryptographic keys necessary to operate the
terminal. MIDS JTRS contains embedded
COMSEC and is capable of processing up to
TOP SECRET information. Each MIDS JTRS
contains an embedded SRU that is UNCLAS-
SIFIED Controlled Cryptographic Informa-
tion (CCI). Un-keyed terminals and de-ener-
gized terminals are UNCLASSIFIED CCI.
When a terminal is operating on the host
platform it is classified up to the level of
data being transmitted.
2. If a technologically advanced adversary
were to obtain knowledge of the specific
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures or equivalent systems, which
might reduce weapon system effectiveness or
be used in the development of a system with
similar or advanced capabilities.
3. A determination has been made that
Canada can provide substantially the same
degree of protection for the technology being
released as the U.S. Government. This sale
supports the U.S. foreign policy and national
security objectives as outlined in the Policy
Justification.
4. All defense articles and services listed in
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to Canada.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION
Egypt—Follow on Technical Support (FOTS)
The Government of Egypt has requested a
possible sale of Follow on Technical Support
(FOTS) that provides for material and labor
services in support of Oliver Hazard Perry
Class Frigates (FFG-7) class ships), Fast Mis-
sile Craft (FMC), Mine Hunter Coastal (MHC)
ships, Coastal Mine Hunter (CMH) ships, and
25 Meter and 28 Meter Fast Patrol Craft
(FPC). The estimated cost is $554 million.
This proposed sale will support the foreign
policy and national security of the United
States by helping to provide a strategic part-
ner with critical support for multiple type
ships responsible for Egypt’s maritime secu-
rity. The proposed sale is essential to main-
tain Egypt’s national security, regional sta-
bility, and the free flow of worldwide com-
merce via the Suez Canal.
Egypt intends to use this technical main-
tenance and service support to ensure the
Egyptian Navy is operationally capable of
providing coastal defense and security. The
proposed sale will increase the Egyptian
Navy’s material and operational readiness.
Egypt will have no difficulties absorbing this
support into its armed forces.
The proposed sale will not alter the basic
military balance in the region.
The prime contractor for Engineering
Services Support will be VSE Corporation
and U.S. Government activities will provide
FOTS for Egypt. There are no known offset
agreements proposed in connection with this
potential sale.
Implementation of this proposed sale will
require periodic trips to Egypt involving
U.S. Government and contractor representa-
tives for technical reviews, support, and
oversight for approximately five years.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposal
sale.

tant force for political stability, peace, and
economic progress in the Inda-Pacific and
South Asia region.
India needs this follow-on support to main-
tain its operational readiness and ability to
provide Humanitarian Assistance and Dis-
aster Relief (HA/DR) assistance in the re-
gion. India will have no difficulty absorbing
this support into its armed forces.
The proposed sale of this equipment and
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region.
The prime contractor will be the Boeing
Corporation, Chicago, Illinois. There are no
known offset agreements proposed in connec-
tion with this potential sale, however, the
purchaser typically requests offsets. Any off-
set agreement will be defined in negotiations

est allies in the INDOPACOM Theater. The
Republic of Korea is one of the major polit-
ical and economic powers in East Asia and
the Western Pacific and a key partner of the
United States in ensuring peace and stability
in that region. It is vital to U.S. national in-
terests to assist the Republic of Korea in de-
veloping and maintaining a strong and ready
self-defense capability.
This proposed sale will enable the Republic
of Korea to sustain and operate its fleet of
RQ–4 Block 30 remotely piloted aircraft and
will significantly advance U.S. interests in
standardization with the Republic of Korea’s
Armed Forces. The potential sale will fur-
ther strengthen the interoperability between
the United States and the Republic of Korea
and ensures the Alliance has a robust intel-
ligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
(ISR) capability on the Korean peninsula.
The ROK will have no difficulty absorbing
this equipment into its armed forces.
The proposed sale of this equipment and
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region.
The principal contractor will be Northrop
Grumman Corporation located in Palmdale,
CA. There are no known offset agreements
proposed in conjunction with this potential
sale. Any offset agreement will be defined in
negotiations between the Purchaser and the

Implementation of the proposed sale will
not require the assignment of any additional
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to the ROK.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed
sale.
All defense articles and services in this
transmittal have been approved for release
and export to the Republic of Korea.

Congress required 24/7 monitoring of the
advanced F–16s and AMRAAMs in the origi-
nal LOA, which is carried out by the Tech-
nical Security Teams (TST) at Shahbaz and
Mushaf Air Force bases. The TST exists to
protect sensitive U.S technology through 24/

The proposed sale of this support will not
alter the basic military balance in the re-
gion.
The principal contractor is Booz Allen

Fairborn, Ohio.
Implementation of this proposed sale will
require the assignment of 60 contractor rep-
resentatives to Pakistan to assist in the
oversight of operations as part of the Peace

POLICY JUSTIFICATION
Thailand—Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicles
The Government of Thailand has requested
to buy sixty (60) Stryker Infantry Carrier
Vehicles (ICV); and sixty (60) M2 Flex .50 cal
machine guns. Also included are spare parts,
Basic Issue Items (BII), Components of End
Items (COEI), Additional Authorized List
(AAL) (specific items for operations and
maintenance), Special Tools and Test Equip-
ment (STTE), technical manuals, OCONUS
Deprocessing Service, M6 smoke grenade
launchers (4 per vehicle) and associated

(DVE), AN/VIC–3 vehicle intercommunica-
tions system, contractor provided training
and Field Service Representatives (FSR),
and other related elements of logistics and
program support. The total estimated pro-
gram cost is $175 million.
This proposed sale will support the foreign
policy and national security objectives of
the United States by helping to improve se-
curity of a Major Non-NATO ally in INDO-
PACOM which is an important force for po-
litical stability and economic progress in the
region.
The Stryker vehicles will increase Thai-
land’s capability to defend its sovereign ter-
ritory against traditional and non-tradi-
tional threats by filling the capability void
between light infantry soldiers and heavy
mechanized units. Thailand will have no dif-
ficulty absorbing this equipment into its
armed forces.
The proposed sale of this equipment and
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region.
The principal contractor for the Stryker
vehicle is General Dynamics Land Systems,
Sterling Heights, MI. There are no known
offset agreements proposed in connection
with this potential sale.
Implementation of this proposed sale will
not require the assignment of any permanent
additional U.S. Government or Contractor
representatives to Thailand.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed
sale.

frequency and near-term digital radio sys-
tems. The Stryker is deployable by C–130 air-
craft and combat capable upon arrival. The
Stryker is capable of self-deployment by
highway and self-recovery. It has a low noise
level that reduces crew fatigue and enhances
survivability. It moves about the battlefield
quickly and is optimized for close, complex,
or urban terrain. The Stryker program
leverages nondevelopmental items with com-
mon subsystems and components to quickly
acquire and field these systems. Stryker is
UNCLASSIFIED.
2. The AN/VAS–5 Driver’s Vision Enhancer
(DVE) is a compact thermal camera pro-
viding armored vehicle drivers with day or
night time visual awareness in clear or re-
duced vision (fog, smoke, dust) situation.
The system provides the driver a 180 degree
viewing angle using a high resolution infra-
red sensor and image stabilization to reduce
the effect of shock and vibration. The viewer
and monitor are ruggedized for operation in
tactical environments. The system is UN-
CLASSIFIED but considered SENSITIVE
technology.
3. If a technologically advanced adversary
were to obtain knowledge of the specific
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system
effectiveness or be used in the development
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities.
4. A determination has been made that
Thailand can provide substantially the same
degree of protection for the technology being
released as the U.S. Government. This sale
supports the U.S. foreign policy and national
security objectives as outlined in the Policy
Justification.
5. All defense articles and services listed in
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to Thailand.

NOMINATION OF DANIEL HABIB
JORJANI
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President,
today I wish to give notice of my in-
tent to object to any unanimous con-
sent agreement regarding Senate Exec-
utive Calendar No. 367, the nomination
of Daniel Jorjani to be Solicitor at the
Department of the Interior.
Recently released documents reveal
that, during Mr. Jorjani’s confirmation
hearing before the U.S. Senate Energy
and Natural Resources Committee, he
knowingly gave misleading and un-
truthful testimony about the Depart-
ment’s Freedom of Information Act—
FOIA—policy.
Department officials appear to have
created a policy with regard to the
Freedom of Information Act allowing
political appointees to delay and
thwart the release of information to
the public. Worse still, when I asked
Mr. Jorjani about this policy, he told
me it didn’t exist.
Attempts by political appointees at
the Department to delay, stonewall,
and otherwise inhibit public and con-
gressional oversight are completely un-
acceptable. This sort of rank political
interference with government account-
ability runs contrary to the very basis
of our form of government.
On February 28, 2019, the Department
issued an updated version of its formal
‘‘Awareness Review’’ policy, which out-
lines the Department’s review process
for FOIA document productions. How-
ever, based on documents obtained
through multiple FOIA requests, it ap-
pears the Department has a supple-
mental process for document produc-
tions that has not previously been
made public.
Mr. Jorjani appeared before the U.S.
Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee on May 2, 2019, for his con-
firmation hearing to serve as the De-
partment’s Solicitor. During Mr.
Jorjani’s hearing and in written testi-
mony he provided the Committee
shortly thereafter, he told me this sup-
plemental awareness review process did
not exist.
Currently, the Department’s inspec-
tor general is conducting a review of
Interior’s FOIA policies. In addition, I
have asked the U.S. Department of
Justice to look into whether Mr.
Jorjani perjured himself before the
committee.
I cannot condone the movement of
Mr. Jorjani’s nomination. Therefore, I
will object to any unanimous consent
agreement to consider Mr. Jorjani’s
nomination.

150TH ANNIVERSARY OF
MADAWASKA, MAINE
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I
rise today to commemorate the 150th
anniversary of the Town of Madawaska
ME. Located in Aroostook County, our
State’s northernmost region,
Madawaska is in the heart of the St.
John River Valley, the center of our
rich Acadian culture. I am honored to
celebrate the generations of indus-
trious and caring people who have
made Madawaska such a wonderful
place to live, work, and raise families.
Madawaska has a fascinating history.
For thousands of years, the St. John
River Valley has been the home of the
Maliseet Tribe. French explorers, led
by Samuel de Champlain, first visited
the area in 1604 and established friend-
ly relationships with the Native Ameri-
cans.
In 1785, French-speaking Canadians
fleeing persecution in British Canada
journeyed up the St. John River in
search of liberty. They marked the
spot of their landing with a large wood-
en cross in gratitude for the safe haven
they had found. Today, the rebuilt Aca-
dian Cross is an enduring reminder of
the determination and courage of those
first settlers. The Tante Blanche Mu-
seum honors the heroism and compas-
sion of Marguerite Blanche Thibodeau
Cyr, who fed the hungry and cared for
the sick during a famine in 1797.
The Maliseets often provided vital
assistance during the first difficult
years. From fertile soil, vast forests,
and their own hard work, the settlers
created a prosperous community that
laid the foundation for the vibrant
Acadian culture that is so important in
Maine, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia,
and as far away as Louisiana.
Following the American Revolution,
the region was the scene of a decades-
long border dispute between our new
Nation and British Canada. Although
the bloodless Aroostook War did not
result in armed conflict, it was a period
of great tension and uncertainty, with
both sides seeking control of the in-
creasingly valuable timberlands. As
the national governments of Great
Britain and the United States nego-
tiated a peaceful resolution, the prov-
ince of New Brunswick laid claim to
the disputed area. On July 4, 1827, a
band of pro-American settlers declared
the independence of the Republic of
Madawaska with its own flag and the
intention of joining the United States.
In response, the Maine Legislature
established the Territory of
Madawaska in 1831, creating what was
called the world’s biggest town, with
an area of more than 4,000 square
miles. The border dispute was settled
by treaty in 1842. Peace was main-
tained between the United States and
Canada. Settlement to the region in-
crease greatly, and in 1869, the town of
Madawaska was incorporate.
Today, more than 80 percent of the
town’s residents speak French, and
they continue to uphold the Acadian
traditions of great food, music, and
dance, and of close-knit families and
lasting friendships. The annual Aca-
dian Festival in August is a highlight
of the year and a funfilled celebration
of this great heritage.

To my Franco-American friends, it is
a pleasure to congratulate you on this
landmark anniversary. Across the gen-
erations, you have worked hard and
worked together to create a commu-
nity that combines your rich heritage
with the values that define our State

Mr. President, the celebration of
Madawaska’s 150th anniversary is not
merely about the passing of time, it is
about human accomplishment. We cel-
ebrate the people who pulled together,
cared for one another, and built a great

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO LARRY ROBERTSON
∑ Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, today I
wish to recognize my friend Larry Rob-
ertson, a dedicated servant to the great
people of West Virginia. After 20 years,
Larry will be retiring from his post as
executive director of HospiceCare, in
my hometown of Charleston, WV. As a
lifelong residence of the State capital
city, Larry dedicated his career to car-
ing for those in his area. He hasn’t
moved around much, with his office
only a mile or two down the road from
the fill station his father worked at
when he was just a boy.
After graduating from George Wash-
ington High School, Larry stuck
around the Kanawha River Valley and
enrolled in Morris Harvey College,
which is now known as the University
of Charleston. With his bachelor’s de-
gree complete and after earning a mas-
ter’s in accounting from the West Vir-
ginia College of Graduate Studies in
1976, he set his sights on ways to give
back to the community that had al-
ready given him so much. This com-
mitment led Larry to take a job as a
controller for the Blue Cross Medical
Plan in Charleston.
From this point on, Larry would
spend the entirety of his professional
life committed to providing financial
support and administrative services to
not-for-profit organizations in the
healthcare field. In the past 20 years,
HospiceCare has flourished under
Larry’s leadership, providing over 300
jobs and services to 16 counties in West
Virginia. Larry and HospiceCare also
provide the community with an avenue
to give back to those in need, gar-
nering hundreds of volunteers through-
out the years. There is an old saying
that says there is nothing stronger
than the heart of a volunteer, but I be-
lieve Larry’s ‘‘Hospice Heart’’ is even
stronger.
Larry has also been instrumental in
the foundation and the success of West
Virginias first inpatient hospice cen-
ter, the Hubbard Hospice House. This
project started out with only enough
space and staff to accommodate 12 resi-
dents, but has grown exponentially
under the vison of Larry and his dedi-
cated team. By the end of this year,
the Hubbard Hospice House operation
will be able to house 56 beds in several
locations across central West Virginia.
I became familiar with hospice during
the last stage of my parents lives. The
support and dedication they give to
their patients is a wonderful lifeline
for families and caregivers. I am in-
credibly indebted to Larry and his staff
for their professional services. Hun-
dreds of families in Kanawha County
and the surrounding area feel the same
and share the same appreciation for
the care hospice gave their family
members. Thank you, Larry, for your
dedication to building such a quality
healthcare provider for end of life care
that is so highly regarded throughout
the State and region.
Larry will now have more time to
spend with his grandchildren, watch
the West Virginia Mountaineers, and
work on his golf game, but the lasting
effects for what he did for our State
will continue on for generations to
come. I wish Larry all the best in his
retirement, as he continues to make a
difference in his community with his
one-of-a-kind attitude and generous
heart. It is truly an honor to call you
friend and fellow West Virginian.∑

RECOGNIZING CAREY, IDAHO
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, along
with my colleagues Senator JAMES
RISCH and Representative MIKE SIMP-
SON, I congratulate the city of Carey,
ID, on its centennial anniversary.
In 1884, just a few years after the first
settlers arrived in the area, a school
was built next to James Carey’s Post
Office. Homes, roads, and churches
soon joined the landscape, dem-
onstrating early on the characteristics
that are readily associated with Carey
today: selflessness, hard work, and de-
termination to make their slice of
Idaho neighborly and productive. By
the time the residents of Carey got
around to incorporating the town in
1919, a sense of community was already
deeply rooted.
On July 20, 2019, the city of Carey
celebrated its 100-year anniversary of
its establishment with special events,
including a parade, music, rodeo, and
other activities. This picturesque com-
munity in Blaine County, ID, is in a
beautiful area rich in history and ex-
traordinary people. The area has a deep
legacy of sheep herding and cattle
ranching and has been home to re-
markable Idahoans, including pioneers,
ranchers, producers, conservationists,
writers, and leaders. Among them was
the late, former Idaho secretary of
state Pete Cenarrusa, a beloved public
servant and veteran, who ran a success-
ful sheep operation with his wife of 66
years, Freda.
Pete is Carey’s most famous son. In
Idaho, Pete’s legendary achievements
are well known. He was a member of
the 1940 University of Idaho NCAA na-
tional champion boxing team, served as
a World War II fighter pilot, and he
holds the record for Idaho’s longest
serving elected official at 52 years. One
validating experience exemplifying
Pete’s political will and influence oc-
curred in 1948 when he convinced Presi-
dent Harry Truman to visit his home-
town of Carey and dedicate the Carey
Airport, which, according to some ac-
counts, was built in a single day—a
story that is reflective of a proud and
dedicated public servant and com-
mitted townspeople. Pete Cenarrusa
and Carey, ID, are synonymous among
most in Idaho, each possessing their
own distinct legacy, despite being
deeply-entwined, that has contributed
mightily to our State’s history and
success.
The residents of Carey have much to
celebrate. In addition to building a
welcoming community settled in an
amazing part of our great State, rec-
reational opportunities abound, includ-
ing skiing, fishing, hiking, biking, and
hunting. Past and present-day Carey
residents have developed Carey into a
community built on a foundation of re-
sourcefulness and good will with an eye
toward how to further grow and make
progress for the betterment of its resi-
dents.
Congratulations to the residents of
Carey on 100 years of accomplishments,
principal among them building a lovely
town where people can live full lives. If
this is a suitable, primary measure of a
successful community, you have more
than succeeded. We wish you well for
centuries to come.∑

RECOGNIZING EMPIRE AIRLINES
∑ Mr. RISCH. Madam President, Ida-
ho’s entrepreneurs are passionate indi-
viduals who consistently innovate and
provide high-quality products and serv-
ices. As a member and former chair-
man of the Senate Committee on Small
Business and Entrepreneurship, it is
my distinct privilege to recognize Em-
pire Airlines as the Idaho Small Busi-
ness of the Month for August 2019. Lo-
cated in Hayden, Empire Airlines is an
international air carrier and heavy
maintenance repair station with dec-
ades of experience and a history of suc-
cess.
In 1977, Nick Chenoweth and Vic Wal-
ters founded Clearwater Flying Serv-
ice, which later became Empire Air-
lines. Neither Chenoweth nor Walters
were pilots, nor had they any experi-
ence running an airline. A third part-
ner, Mel Spelde, joined the company
just 2 months later as flight instructor
and manager. Early jobs for the busi-
ness included fire patrol, air ambu-
lance, charters, flight instruction,
transporting backcountry hunters and
anglers, and cloud seeding in Libya.
The business quickly adopted a ‘‘go
anywhere, do anything’’ attitude,
which is reflected in its motto, ‘‘We
Can Do That.’’ As the business grew,
they eventually changed the name to
Empire Airlines. Now run by president
and CEO, Tim Komberec, Empire Air-
lines focuses on cargo, maintenance,
and airline startups.
Over the years, Empire steadily grew
but never lost the try-anything, go-
anywhere spirit embodied in its motto.
Empire now has an aerospace division
to provide state-of-the-art mainte-
nance for aircraft, as well as an un-
manned division, which provides drone
services to help clients solve problems
and reach goals. Empire Airlines also
provides consulting services to help
others jump-start their airline oper-
ation.
Empire Airlines strives to be a val-
ued member of the community, sup-
porting various charities and causes,
including drug-free high school gradua-
tion parties in the area and numerous
other events. What might be most im-
pressive is the way Empire celebrates
the many employees who have reached
25 years with the company by giving
them a place in the timeline of the
company’s history posted publicly on
its website.
Empire Airlines’ success is a prime
example of Idaho’s entrepreneurial
spirit: Dare to dream, look at things
differently, never give up, and when op-
portunity calls, answer with ‘‘We can
do that.’’ The State of Idaho is proud
to be home to innovative, hard-work-
ing entrepreneurs like Nick, Vic, Mel,
and all of those at Empire Airlines.
The entire Empire family shows how
one big idea and a dedication to hard
work can lead to small business suc-
cess. I would like to congratulate Tim
Komberec and all of the employees at
Empire Airlines on being named the
‘‘Idaho Small Business of the Month’’
for August 2019. I look forward to
watching your continued growth and
success.∑

TRIBUTE TO BETH ANNE
MALONEY
∑ Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President,
today I would like to recognize Ms.
Beth Anne Maloney of Hampton, NH,
and celebrate her well-deserved retire-
ment after 31 years of service to the
students in that community as a
school nurse.
After beginning her nursing career in
1984, Beth joined the staff of Centre El-
ementary School in Hampton in the
fall of 1988. Centre School serves rough-
ly 350 prekindergarten through grade 2
students and has the distinction of
being the oldest public school in the
State of New Hampshire. Beth was the
school’s first full-time registered
nurse, and she has overseen the mod-
ernizing of the school’s health services.
Over the years, Beth connected with
thousands of students while carrying
out her daily duties of assessing
health, conducting vision and hearing
screenings, and acting as a first re-
sponder. She developed particularly
close relationships with students who
had chronic conditions that required
specialized care and management, in-
cluding epilepsy, allergies, and asthma.
Over time, she gained significant expe-
rience assisting students with type 1
diabetes, who often require daily nurs-
ing assistance with their diet, blood
sugar monitoring, and medication.
Beth was actively engaged in devel-
oping care plans for these students
that would minimize interruptions to
their daily schedules, and she contin-
ually trained her fellow staff members
to prevent and respond to diabetic
emergencies.
In addition to her nursing duties,
Beth was a tireless advocate for stu-
dents in need of health-related serv-
ices, which could range from immuni-
zations or a new pair of glasses to spe-
cialized care for untreated conditions.
She maintained numerous relation-
ships with seacoast area health pro-
viders willing to help the families of

f
PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS
The following petition or memorial
was laid before the Senate and was re-
ferred or ordered to lie on the table as
indicated:
POM–123. A concurrent resolution adopted
by the Legislature of the State of Missouri
calling on the President of the United States
to undertake a full and transparent inves-
tigation by the United States Department of
State into organ transplant practices in the
People’s Republic of China, and to call for
the prosecution of those found to have en-
gaged in such unethical practices; to the
Committee on Foreign Relations.
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 6
Whereas, extensive and credible reports
have revealed mass killing of prisoners of
conscience in the People’s Republic of China,
primarily practitioners of the spiritual based
exercises of Falun Gong, but also other reli-
gious and ethnic minority groups, in order to
obtain organs for transplants; and
Whereas, the organ transplantation system
in China docs not comply with the World
Health Organization’s Guiding Principles of
traceability and transparency in organ pro-
curement pathways, and the government of
the People’s Republic of China has resisted
independent scrutiny of the system; and
Whereas, traditional Chinese custom re-
quires bodies to be preserved intact after
death. With rare voluntary organ donation,
however, China’s transplantation industry
significantly increased since 2000; and
Whereas, the 2017 Freedom House Report
‘‘The Battle for China’s Spirit’’ slates that
‘‘Available evidence suggests that forced ex-
traction of organs from Falun Gong detain-
ees for sale in transplant operations has oc-
curred on a large scale and may be con-
tinuing’’; and
Whereas, an investigative report, published
in June 2016, conducted by human rights at-
torney David Matas, former Canadian Sec-
retary of State for Asia-Pacific David
Kilgour, and journalist Ethan Gutmann, es-
timated that China is performing 60,000 to
100,000 transplants per year as opposed to
10,000 transplants claimed by the Chinese
government, which is ‘‘an industrial-scale,
state-directed organ transplantation system,
controlled through national policies and
funding, and implicating both the military
and civilian healthcare systems’’; and
Whereas, China’s Liver Transplant Reg-
istry System indicated that more than 25%
of cases were emergency transplants, for
which an organ was found within days or
even hours. Wait times for non-emergency
liver transplants were usually quoted in
weeks. Most patients in other countries have
to wait years for a transplant; and
Whereas, the Chinese government claims
that 90% of China’s organ transplant sources
come from executed prisoners. However, the
number of executions has dropped 10% annu-
ally since 2002 and is far less than the num-
ber of transplants taking place. The govern-
ment has never acknowledged the sourcing
of organs from prisoners of conscience; and
Whereas, Falun Gong, a spiritual practice
involving meditative ‘‘qigong’’ exercises and
centered on the values of truthfulness, com-
passion, and forbearance, became immensely
popular in China in the 1990s, with multiple
estimates placing the number or practi-
tioners at upwards of 70 million; and
Whereas, in July 1999, the Chinese Com-
munist Party launched an intensive, nation-
wide persecution designed to eradicate the
spiritual practice of Falun Gong, including
physical and mental torture, reflecting the
party’s long-standing intolerance or large
independent civil society groups; and
Whereas, since 1999, hundreds of thousands
of Falun Gong practitioners have been de-
tained extra-legally in Chinese reeducation-
through-labor camps, detention centers. and
prisons, where torture, abuse, and implau-
sible medical exams and blood tests on Falun
Gong practitioners are routine; and
Whereas, Freedom House reported in 2015
that Falun Gong practitioners comprise the
largest portion of prisoners of conscience in
China, and face an elevated risk or dying or
being killed in custody; and
Whereas, the United Nations Committee
Against Torture and the Special Rapporteur
on Torture have expressed concern over the
allegations of organ harvesting from Falun
Gong prisoners, and have called on the Gov-
ernment of the People’s Republic or China to
increase accountability and transparency in
the organ transplant system and punish
those responsible for abuses; and
Whereas, in June 2016, the U.S. House of
Representatives unanimously passed House
Resolution 343, condemning the systematic,
state-sanctioned organ harvesting from
Falun Gong and other prisoners of con-
science; and
Whereas, the killing of religious or polit-
ical prisoners for the purpose of selling their
organs for transplant is an egregious and in-
tolerable violation of the fundamental right
to live; and
Whereas, organ tourism to China should
not be shielded by medical confidentiality,
but openly monitored. No nation should
allow their citizens to go to China for organs
until China has allowed a full investigation
into organ harvesting of prisoners of con-
science, both past and present: Now there-
fore be it
Resolved, That the members of the Missouri
Senate, One-Hundredth General Assembly,
First Regular Session, the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring therein:
(1) Call upon the Government or the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China to immediately end
the practice of organ harvesting from all
prisoners and prisoners of conscience, and
explicitly from Falun Gong prisoners or con-
science and members of other religious and
ethnic minority groups:
(2) Call upon the Government of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China to immediately end

the 17-year persecution of the Falun Gong,
and the immediate release of all Falun Gong
practitioners and other prisoners of con-
science;
(3) Call upon the President of the United
States to undertake a full and transparent
investigation by the United States Depart-
ment of State into organ transplant prac-
tices in the People’s Republic of China, and
calls for the prosecution of those found to
have engaged in such unethical practices;
(4) Encourage the medical community of
Missouri to engage in educating colleagues
and residents of Missouri about the risks of
travel to China for organ transplants so as to
help prevent Missouri residents from unwit-
tingly becoming involved in murder in the
form of forced organ harvesting from pris-
oners of conscience; and
(5) Agree to take measures to ban the
entry of those who have participated in ille-
gal removal of human tissues and organs,
and seek prosecution of such individuals
should they be found on the soil of Missouri;
and be it further
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Mis-
souri Senate be instructed to prepare prop-
erly inscribed copies of this resolution for
the President and Vice President of the
United States, the President and Secretary
of the United States Senate, the Speaker and
Clerk of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, the chair of the Senate Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs, the chair of the
House Committee on Foreign Relations, and
each member of Missouri’s Congressional
delegation.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr.
PETERS, Ms. MCSALLY, and Mrs.
SHAHEEN):
S. 2322. A bill to amend the Animal
Welfare Act to allow for the retirement
of certain animals used in Federal re-
search; to the Committee on Agri-
culture, Nutrition, and Forestry.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am
pleased to join my colleague from
Michigan, Senator PETERS, in intro-
ducing the Animal Freedom from Test-
ing, Experiments, and Research Act,
known as the AFTER Act, to promote
the adoption or retirement of animals
used for research at Federal agencies. I
would also like to thank Senators SHA-
HEEN and MCSALLY who are original co-
sponsors of this legislation.
In fiscal year 2018, the Federal gov-
ernment experimented on approxi-
mately 50,000 animals for research pur-
poses. The experiments occurred across
twelve different Federal agencies and
the animals used were mainly cats,
dogs, monkeys, and rabbits. While
tracking these animals following ex-
perimentation is challenging, once ani-
mals are no longer needed for research,
they are often killed, since many agen-
cies lack formal retirement or adop-
tion policies. With that said, recent
studies indicate that research animals
who are adopted often thrive in their
new environments.
In 2013, led by Senators HARKIN,
ALEXANDER, CANTWELL and myself, the
Senate passed the CHIMP Act, which
allowed for the retirement of hundreds
of primates that were formerly being
used in National Institute of Health
(NIH) experiments. In addition, the De-
partments of Defense, Veteran Affairs,
and NIH recently enacted successful
animal retirement policies. While I am
encouraged by the Senate’s past work
on primates and the recent policies de-
veloped by a few agencies; there are
still many Federal agencies, including
the Departments of Agriculture, Inte-
rior, Commerce, NASA, the Environ-
mental Protection Agency that lack
formal policies for animals that have
been used in experiments.
The AFTER Act builds on successful
policies at DOD, VA, and NIH by di-
recting all Federal agencies to promul-
gate regulations that would facilitate
the retirement of laboratory animals.
The bill provides flexibility for each
agency to devise its own policy, with
the goal of ensuring that such animals,
whenever possible, are retired and not
killed. Additionally, the AFTER Act
requires animals to be evaluated by a
licensed veterinarian and pronounced
both mentally and physically healthy
before leaving an agency. This will help
ensure a smooth transition to a new
environment.
Our legislation also encourages Fed-
eral agencies to work with non-profit
organizations to ensure retired animals
are distributid to sanctuaries and shel-
ters across the Nation, not just those
closest to the research facility. This
would allow a State like Maine, which
does not have Federal research labs
that use animals, to play a role in re-
tiring these animals and providing
homes for them.
Mr. President, there is no reason ani-
mals that are suitable for adoption or
retirement should be killed by our Fed-
eral government. The AFTER Act
would provide the necessary direction
Federal agencies need in order to move
forward with developing retirement
policies. I urge all of my colleagues to
join in support of this important bipar-
tisan legislation, the Animal Freedom
from Testing, Experiments, and Re-
search Act.

submitted the following resolution;
which was referred to the Committee
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions:
S. RES. 291
Whereas the Fédération Internationale de
Football Association (referred to in this pre-
amble as ‘‘FIFA’’) awarded $400,000,000 to the
32 teams that competed in the 2018 Men’s
World Cup, but only awarded $30,000,000 to
the 24 teams that competed in the 2019 Wom-
en’s World Cup;
Whereas FIFA awarded $38,000,000 to the
team that won the 2018 Men’s World Cup, but
only awarded $4,000,000 to the team that won
the 2019 Women’s World Cup;
Whereas FIFA awarded $4,000,000 more in
prizes to each team that lost in the first
round of the 2018 Men’s World Cup than to
the team that won the 2019 Women’s World
Cup;
Whereas FIFA awarded $358,000,000 to the
32 teams that competed in the 2014 Men’s
World Cup, but only awarded $15,000,000 to
the 24 teams that competed in the 2015 Wom-
en’s World Cup; and
Whereas FIFA awarded $35,000,000 to the
team that won the 2014 Men’s World Cup, but
only awarded $2,000,000 to the team that won
the 2015 Women’s World Cup;
Whereas FIFA awarded $348,000,000 to the
32 teams that competed in the 2010 Men’s
World Cup, but only awarded $10,000,000 to
the 16 teams that competed in the 2011 Wom-
en’s World Cup;
Whereas FIFA awarded $30,000,000 to the
team that won the 2010 Men’s World Cup, but
only awarded $1,000,000 to the team that won
the 2011 Women’s World Cup;
Whereas the 2019 Women’s World Cup tour-
nament garnered an estimated 1,000,000,000
viewers worldwide;
Whereas the 2019 Women’s World Cup high-
lighted the need to eliminate the existing
gender pay disparity in prize award structure
in athletic competitions that has persisted
for decades;
Whereas the unfair and unjust prize award
allocation system used by FIFA sends a ter-
rible message to women and girls around the
world about the value of their contribution
to sports;
Whereas, in 2007, Wimbledon finally imple-
mented an equal prize payment structure for
all athletes, regardless of gender; and
Whereas gender should not determine the
amount of a prize award that a person or
team receives in an athletic competition:
Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) urges the Fédération Internationale de
Football Association to immediately elimi-
nate gender pay inequity and to treat all
athletes with the respect and dignity those
athletes deserve;
(2) supports an end to the unfair and unjust
practice of gender pay inequity in the work-
place, including athletic competitions and
related prize awards;
(3) urges all other local, State, Federal,
and international organizations to eliminate
gender pay inequity; and
(4) instructs the Secretary of the Senate to
submit a copy of this resolution to the Presi-
dent of the Fédération Internationale de
Football Association.
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier
this month, fans across the country—
and around the world—watched as the
U.S. Women’s National Team made his-
tory, winning its second consecutive
World Cup title, and fourth title over-
all. The players, coaches, and support
staff of the Women’s National Team
are role models to athletes young and
old, male and female. They played
through the tournament with the te-
nacity, skill, and commitment that is
the hallmark of any champion.
These women—world class athletes—
have consistently demonstrated their
dedication to excelling in the sport and
to representing our nation on the world
stage. Their success on the soccer field
is remarkable in itself, but many of
these women have used their voices to
speak out and speak up against a glar-
ing disparity that disadvantages them,
and countless women across our coun-
try and around the world: equal pay.
This is not a new issue, and it’s
shameful that it is one that has not
been rectified. What the players of the
U.S. women’s soccer team want is pret-
ty simple: to be treated no different
than their counterparts on the men’s
team. Earlier this year, the players
filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Soccer
Federation, arguing that disparities in
pay between the men’s and women’s
teams constitute discrimination on the
basis of gender. But even if this lawsuit
improves U.S. Soccer pay practices,
much of the pay disparity will remain,
due to policies of the Fédération Inter-
nationale de Football Association
(FIFA). For example, FIFA awarded $38
million to the winner of the 2018 Men’s
World Cup, but will award only $4 mil-
lion to the U.S. women’s team for their
win this year. Men’s teams also earn
more from FIFA for losing a World Cup
qualifying game than women’s teams
earn for winning all of them and be-
coming world champions.
Today I am reintroducing a resolu-
tion that I first introduced in 2015,
after the U.S. Women’s National Team
won its third World Cup. This is a sim-
ple, straightforward, and commonsense
resolution. I am calling on FIFA to im-
mediately eliminate gender pay in-
equity and treat all athletes with the
same respect and dignity, regardless of
gender. Yet in 2015, Senate Republicans

inexplicably objected to its adoption.
I’m still waiting for an explanation as
to why.
I’m proud that this resolution is co-
sponsored by Senators SHELDON WHITE-
HOUSE (D–R.I.), PATTY MURRAY (D–

HIRANO (D–Hawaii), KIRSTEN GILLI-

Equal pay for equal work should not
be a political football. All women, in-
cluding the women of the U.S. National
Team, deserve to be paid for the job
they do, not based on their gender.
Equal pay should not still be up for de-
bate in 2019.
When time expired on the game clock
during the World Cup championship
game, chants of ‘‘Equal Pay!’’ echoed
throughout the stadium in France. I
am proud to join in that chorus today.

SENATE RESOLUTION 292—CALL-
ING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF
CAMEROON AND ARMED SEPA-
RATIST GROUPS TO RESPECT
THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF ALL
CAMEROONIAN CITIZENS, TO END
ALL VIOLENCE, AND TO PURSUE
AN INCLUSIVE DIALOGUE TO RE-
SOLVE THE CONFLICT IN THE
NORTHWEST AND SOUTHWEST
REGIONS
Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. YOUNG,
Mr. DURBIN, Mr. LANKFORD, Mr. VAN
HOLLEN, Mr. MARKEY, Mr. COONS, Mr.
KAINE, and Mr. MERKLEY) submitted
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign
Relations:
S. RES. 292
Whereas Paul Biya has held office as Cam-
eroon’s President since 1982, and won reelec-
tion to a seventh term in October 2018;
Whereas Cameroon receives United States
foreign aid and participates in the Depart-
ment of State-led Trans-Sahara Counter-
Terrorism Partnership (TSCTP) and United
States-supported efforts to counter Boko
Haram;
Whereas the Government of Cameroon has
increasingly cracked down on political ex-
pression, including by imprisoning opposi-
tion leaders and supporters, banning opposi-
tion and civil society conferences, rein-
forcing troop deployments to deter and dis-
rupt protests, and restricting access to
Facebook and other social media platforms;
Whereas the Government of Cameroon has
repeatedly restricted freedoms of expression
and the media nationwide by shutting down
the internet, harassing and detaining jour-
nalists, refusing licenses to independent
media, and intensifying political attacks
against the independent press;
Whereas Boko Haram and an Islamic
State-affiliated splinter group have desta-
bilized northern Cameroon since 2014,
marked recently by a June 2019 attack on se-
curity forces in Far North Cameroon that
killed dozens of soldiers and civilians;
Whereas the Boko Haram insurgency in
Cameroon’s Far North region has created an
estimated 263,000 internally displaced per-
sons (IDPs), causing an escalating humani-
tarian crisis in difficult to access areas;
Whereas tensions between predominantly
Christian farmers and predominantly Mus-
lim Fulani herders have contributed to reli-
gious and communal tensions throughout
West and Central Africa in recent years, in-
cluding in the Northwest region of Cam-
eroon;
Whereas members of the Government of
Cameroon’s Rapid Intervention Battalion
(BIR), which receives United States counter-
terrorism training and support, have been
accused of torture and extrajudicial killings
and may be in contravention of congression-
ally mandated ‘‘Leahy human rights vet-
ting’’ requirements;
Whereas the 2018 Department of State
Human Rights Report documented torture
and abuse by Cameroonian security forces,
‘‘prolonged arbitrary detentions including of
suspected Anglophone separatists by secu-
rity forces,’’ and violations of freedoms of
expression and assembly;
Whereas, following Cameroon’s October 7,
2018, elections, the African Union Election
Observation Mission stated that ‘‘the cur-
rent [legal] framework needs to be strength-
ened in order to safeguard the democratic
principles of separation of powers, fairness,
and independence and impartiality,’’ which
the Department of State echoed, empha-
sizing that electoral irregularities ‘‘created
an impression that the election was not cred-
ible or genuinely free and fair’’;
Whereas Anglophone Cameroonians have
long felt marginalized by official actions and
policies of the Government of Cameroon;
Whereas, while the Government of France
has condemned attacks by armed separat-
ists, it has a meaningful role to play in push-
ing the Government of Cameroon to lift re-
strictions on freedoms of expression and the
media, end arbitrary detention, and engage
in inclusive dialogue with Anglophone lead-
ers;
Whereas, beginning in late 2016, protests
organized by lawyers, teachers, and students
were violently repressed by the Government
of Cameroon, leading to numerous deaths
and imprisonments, including of journalists
and lawyers;
Whereas, in January 2017, the Government
of Cameroon ordered the suspension of inter-
net services in the northwest and southwest
regions of Cameroon, the suspension lasting
for 93 days and having a major, debilitating
effect on the economy, educational institu-
tions, freedom of expression, and social com-
munication of the region’s residents;
Whereas the conflict escalated in late Sep-
tember and early October 2017, when
Cameroonian security forces brutally
cracked down on unarmed civilians peace-
fully demonstrating, resulting in at least 20
people dying and leaving over 100 injured;
Whereas, in 2017, armed separatist groups
launched a campaign to pressure school offi-
cials in the Anglophone region to go on
strike as part of a boycott against the Gov-
ernment of Cameroon, and began burning
school buildings and threatening education
officials with violence if they did not com-
ply;
Whereas human rights monitors have docu-
mented armed groups killing traditional
leaders and targeting civilians who are per-
ceived to be supporting or working with the
Government of Cameroon, and armed mili-
tants have killed Cameroonian security force
personnel;
Whereas numerous credible reports from
human rights monitors, including the United
Nations High Commissioner for Human
Rights, have documented the excessive use of
force by Government of Cameroon security
forces against Cameroonians living in the
Anglophone regions, including the burning of
villages, the use of live ammunition against
protestors, arbitrary arrest and detention,
torture, and sexual abuse;
Whereas the Department of State has ex-
pressed serious concern over the Government
of Cameroon’s use of force to restrict free ex-
pression and the use of violence against indi-
viduals protesting the government’s policies
in the Anglophone regions;
Whereas both the Government of Cam-
eroon security forces and armed groups have
been documented targeting and brutally kill-
ing civilians in the Anglophone regions, in-
cluding women and children;
Whereas in February 2019, the Department
of State announced it would withhold some
security assistance to Cameroon, citing cred-
ible allegations that the Cameroonian mili-
tary carried out human rights violations;
Whereas United States citizen Charles
Wesco was senselessly killed near the town
of Bamenda, Cameroon, on October 30, 2018,
after being caught in what the Department
of State has characterized as ‘‘cross fire’’;
Whereas the United Nations Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs stated
in March 2019 that at least 530,000 were inter-
nally displaced in areas affected by the
Anglophone conflict;
Whereas the United Nations Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has es-
timated that $298,900,000 is required to pro-
vide humanitarian assistance throughout
Cameroon, and only 21 percent of the appeal
has been funded as of July 2019;
Whereas the Office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees reported
that it had registered roughly 36,000
Cameroonian refugees from the Anglophone
regions in Nigeria as of April 2019;
Whereas some Cameroonian diaspora orga-
nizations in the United States and
Cameroonian-based civil society organiza-
tions are working to address the needs of
Cameroonian internally displaced persons on
the northwest and southwest regions of the
country and refugees in Nigeria;
Whereas 47 Anglophone activists were forc-
ibly returned from Nigerian custody to
Cameroonian authorities in January 2018, de-
spite many having reportedly submitted asy-
lum claims in Nigeria; and
Whereas 10 of the 47 individuals forcibly re-
turned from Nigeria now face charges before
a military court that would be punishable by
the death penalty, while the other 37 report-
edly remain in detention without charge:
Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) urges all parties to the Anglophone con-
flict in Cameroon, including political opposi-
tion groups, to—
(A) agree to an immediate ceasefire;
(B) guarantee unfettered humanitarian as-
sistance;
(C) exercise restraint and ensure that pro-
tests remain peaceful; and
(D) engage in inclusive dialogue with civil
society to get to a political solution that re-
spects the rights and freedoms of the people
of Cameroon;
(2) strongly condemns the abuses com-
mitted by Boko Haram, state security forces,
and armed groups in the Anglophone regions,
including extrajudicial killings and deten-
tions, the use of force against nonviolent ci-
vilians and protestors, and violations of the
freedoms of press, expression, religion, and
assembly;

ment continues to hold the Government of

SUPPORT FOR ABILITY ONE
PROGRAM
HON. BRADLEY SCOTT SCHNEIDER
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to commend the outstanding work of the
AbilityOne Program, which empowers Ameri-
cans with disabilities and helps bring them into
the workforce. The AbilityOne Program pro-
motes exemplary public-private partnerships to
employ Americans with significant disabilities,
including veterans and the blind. According to
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemploy-
ment rate for Americans with disabilities is
more than double the rate for those without
disabilities. To address this disparity, the
AbilityOne Program creates high-quality em-
ployment opportunities for disabled Americans
and empowers them to fully participate in the
workforce and their communities. AbilityOne
helps employ more than 45,000 disabled
Americans, helping them develop the skills
and work experience they need to access
public and private sector jobs, achieve greater
independence, and lead productive, fulfilling
lives. And the program helps the federal gov-
ernment support these individuals and em-
power them through employment.
Last March, I had the opportunity to see the
success of AbilityOne Program firsthand in my
district when I visited TRI Industries in Vernon
Hills, Illinois. TRI is a non-profit that remanu-
factures ink and toner cartridges for the fed-
eral government. TRI provides education,
training, and jobs to individuals with disabilities
in my district. Touring their facility and speak-
ing with the staff, I saw the great opportunities
AbilityOne provides and the impact this pro-
gram can have on the lives of Americans with
disabilities.
On behalf of my constituents with disabil-
ities, I rise to salute the significant contribu-
tions of the AbilityOne Program, and I support
all persons committed to developing and ad-
vancing employment opportunities for the blind
and Americans with other significant disabil-
ities.

CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF MOUNT ZION MIS-
SIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with
great respect and admiration that I take this
time to congratulate Mount Zion Missionary
Baptist Church of Hammond, Indiana, as the
congregation joins together in celebration of
the church’s 100th anniversary. The parish-
ioners along with Mount Zion’s pastor, Rev-
erend William R. Collins, will be commemo-
rating this momentous occasion with a
celebratory banquet on Friday, August 2,
2019, at the Chateau Banquet Center in
Merrillville, Indiana.
In 1919, Mount Zion Missionary Baptist
Church became the first African American
Baptist church to be established in the city of
Hammond. Throughout the years, numerous
remarkable pastors helped to build the
church’s leadership and expand its congrega-
tion, along with the services and programs of-
fered to the community. In 1945, Reverend
A.R. Burns became pastor of Mount Zion, a
position he held for an astonishing fifty-three
years. Pastor Burns accomplished many great
things during his tenure at Mount Zion, and he
was determined and passionate about his
service. Under Pastor Burns’ leadership, in
1949, the current church structure was com-
pleted at 1047 Kenwood Street, and it became
known as ‘‘The Friendly Place of Worship.’’
Pastor Burns worked to secure safe housing
for the elderly and was able to accomplish the
construction of the Reverend A.R. Burns
Mount Zion Pleasant View Plaza, with the first
tenants moving in by 1983. In addition, Pastor
Burns marched for civil rights with Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr, and he supported the
National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People (NAACP). Pastor Burns
passed away in 1999, but he will be forever
remembered for his faithfulness to his con-
gregation.
In 1998, Reverend William R. Collins be-
came the leader of Mount Zion Missionary
Baptist Church. Under Pastor Collins’ out-
standing direction, Mount Zion has become a
cornerstone of the community, providing a
food pantry and outreach program, offering va-
cation bible school, summer camp ministry,
and various religious retreats, and being heav-
ily involved in the Interfaith Federation. Under
Pastor Collins’ leadership, the church has also
undergone numerous cosmetic improvements,
and the membership has increased exponen-
tially. Reverend Collins and the congregation
of Mount Zion have been a true blessing to
the community of Northwest Indiana and be-
yond.
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my
other distinguished colleagues join me in hon-
oring and congratulating Mount Zion Mis-
sionary Baptist Church in Hammond, Indiana,
on its 100th anniversary. The members and
church leaders have dedicated themselves to
serving others, especially to those most in
need, and they are an inspiration to us all.

IN HONOR OF HENRY RODRIGUEZ
MARTINEZ, SR.
HON. MARC A. VEASEY
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to commemorate the life of Mr. Henry Rodri-
guez Martinez, Sr. of the Dallas-Fort Worth
area.
Martinez was a father, veteran and a local
civil rights leader that was committed to
bettering our community through his public
service. Born on June 15, 1928 in Eagle Ford.
Texas. Martinez was a pillar of strength and
perseverance for our community.
He was raised in the Ledbetter Eagle Ford
area of Dallas and attended Crozier Technical
High School prior to serving in the Army
where he earned the rank of Private First
Class. He was also a proud father and hus-
band. Martinez married Eufemia Paredes Mar-
tinez in 1955 and the couple had eight chil-
dren. For over fifteen years, Martinez served
the Dallas Fort Worth-area through his work
for the Martinez Courier Service and Dallas
Power and Light.
Martinez was also an active member of the
West Dallas community. Throughout his life
and through his service as the president of
Ledbetter Neighborhood Association, Martinez
improved local transit across the community
and the quality of life for those that lived there.
Martinez spent his life making sure that
communities of color had a seat at the table
and a voice in the room—his most notable ac-
complishment being that he was a staunch ad-
vocate in the fight to guarantee better rep-
resentation for people of color in the Dallas
City council.
I want to take this opportunity to extend my
thoughts and prayers to Mr. Martinez’s family
and community. West Dallas is losing a fighter
and advocate for their community. His spirit
and accomplishments will never be able to be
replaced.

COMMISSION TO STUDY THE PO-
TENTIAL CREATION OF A NA-
TIONAL MUSEUM OF ASIAN PA-
CIFIC AMERICAN HISTORY AND
CULTURE ACT
HON. GRACE MENG
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
emphasize the need to weave the narrative of
the Asian American and Pacific Islander com-
munities into the greater American story.
There is no doubt that Asian Americans are
the fastest growing population in the United
States, and our community is becoming an in-
creasingly powerful and visible force in all as-
pects of American life. From entertainment to
medicine; from academia to entrepreneurship;
from social justice to innovation—our commu-
nity has made immeasurable contributions to
every facet of our nation. But, too often, our
community is excluded or forgotten in history.
That is why today, I am introducing the
‘‘Commission to Study the Potential Creation
of a National Museum of Asian Pacific Amer-
ican History and Culture Act’’. With the rise of
recent exclusionary rhetoric and policies, it is
crucial to remember our collective past now
more than ever. The past shapes who we are,
and it also strengthens how we move forward.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1008 July 30, 2019
From the Chinese Exclusion Act to the Jap-
anese American internment camps; from the
racially motivated murder of Vincent Chin to
the first wave of Southeast Asian refugees on
our shores—these historical events have af-
fected the way we deal with policies today.
Nevertheless, these stories are often left out
of history books. A commission to study the
potential creation of a National Museum of
Asian Pacific American history is the first step
in elevating the AAPI profile and ensuring that
Americans of all ethnicities and generations
can learn about the impact our community has
had in our nation’s values, traditions, culture,
and history.
Madam Speaker, I firmly believe the story of
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders is sore-
ly misunderstood and creating a national mu-
seum would ensure that our experiences—
both good and bad—are recognized by all
Americans. Museums are gateways for Ameri-
cans and the world to see the United States’
rich history, challenges it overcame, and po-
tential for greatness. Establishing this commis-
sion is the first step toward the creation of a
national AAPI museum. I urge my colleagues
to support this legislation.

LOREN KANNENBERG
RETIREMENT
HON. RON KIND
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, today I recog-
nize and celebrate the career of my friend and
longtime District Chief of Staff, Loren
Kannenberg. Loren was with me from the be-
ginning, helping set up my district operation in
1997 during my first term in office. Last month
Loren retired after serving the people of Wis-
consin’s Third Congressional District for over
22 years.
Loren was born and raised in Wausau, Wis-
consin. After attending college at the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin-La Crosse, Loren was a
science and math teacher at St. Patrick’s
School in Onalaska. He went on to receive a
Masters in Educational Administration from
Winona State University and later served as
principal at St. Patrick’s School until 1997
when he joined my team.
Loren has always been a leader in the La
Crosse community and active in local politics,
at one point serving as the chair of the La
Crosse County Democratic Party. He was also
a longtime member of the La Crosse County
Health and Human Services Board where he
looked out for his neighbors and the less fortu-
nate in our community. Additionally, he served
on the Redevelopment Authority with the City
of La Crosse, helping guide many projects
such as the new bus depot in downtown La
Crosse and the Riverside North Project which
is now under development.
An avid golfer, Loren has been a trusted
playing partner over the years and has a great
appreciation for the green landscapes we are
blessed with in Wisconsin. Loren is also a tal-
ented musician and a member of the La
Crosse Chamber Chorale. Above all, Loren is
highly regarded by all those who know him as
a family man and friend.
Loren has always been a steady hand in
overseeing my district staff’s casework and
outreach activities with the goal of providing
the best possible services to my constituents.
Loren was at my side as we traveled across
Wisconsin and visited communities from
Platteville to Menomonie and everywhere in
between. Public service was in his blood—his
father, John Kannenberg, served 24 years as
the mayor of Wausau, Wisconsin and 10
years on the Wausau City Council. Loren
made an enduring impact on his colleagues
and the constituents of Wisconsin’s Third Con-
gressional District. I thank Loren for all his
hard work and dedication to public service,
and I wish him all the best on a long and
happy retirement.

BIPARTISAN BUDGET ACT OF 2019
SPEECH OF
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, I support the Bipartisan Budget Caps and
Debt Limit Deal as an important step to pro-
tect Americans and our economy. This agree-
ment secures an additional $100 billion for
crucial services to promote the well-being of
our residents while rejecting the offsets pro-
posed by the current Administration. This
agreement permanently ends the harmful cuts
to non-defense programs that support the
health, housing, education, child care, and se-
curity of Americans via the discretionary se-
quester. It allows continued investment in vet-
erans, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, environmental sustainability, the
National Institutes of Health, and the fight
against drug addiction sweeping the nation, in-
cluding my state of Illinois. This agreement
also protects the full-faith and credit of our
government by raising the country’s debt limit.
As we know, the debt limit was reinstated to
$22 Trillion on March 2, 2019, imposing a
legal limitation on the government’s ability to
issue debt and pay many federal obligations
that directly impact the American people. A
suspension of the debt limit until July 31, 2020
is a critical win for the Democratic Leadership
that protects our national economy.
The sequester and restrictive appropriations
under Republicans have eroded federal sup-
port for programs that help children and fami-
lies in this nation and internationally, cutting
domestic and international programs by 4.6
percent between FY2010 to FY2019 after in-
flation. Constituents in my District have felt
these cuts, and this deal helps rebuild these
important services. In my district with a popu-
lation of approximately 703,000 residents, 30.8
percent of children live in poverty and 15 per-
cent live in extreme poverty, 25 percent of
taxfilers are low-income working parents, and
18.7 percent of adults in my District over 18
have income below the poverty level. These
Chicagoans rely on an array of programs to
work and care for their families. According to
the National Center for Veterans Analysis and
Statistics, in 2016, my district alone had a vet-
eran population of over 41,978 people. These
returning heroes and public servants deserve
a government that serves them and assists
with resources so that they can live the Amer-
ican dream.
This is not a perfect agreement, but it
moves our country forward in very important
ways. I promise to work to end the mandatory
sequester. The mandatory sequester cuts fed-
eral dollars from vital programs including
Medicare, home visiting, the Social Services
Block Grant, and Safe and Stable families—
programs that provide health care for the el-
derly, services for the disabled, and child
abuse prevention—to name a few.
Former National Security Advisor Colin
Powell once said ‘‘Leadership is about solving
problems.’’ I rise today to commend and sup-
port Speaker PELOSI on her leadership and
problem solving skills to rebuild our investment
in children and families via this budget agree-
ment. I support this bill and urge my col-
leagues to do the same.

HONORING KENNEDY’S ANGEL
GOWNS
HON. ELAINE G. LURIA
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Kennedy Milan Wilson. Although she
never took a breath of air outside her mother’s
womb, her memory now brings hope and heal-
ing to so many families. On August 17, 2019,
we honor her, as we do every day. Kennedy
would have been 10 years old this year. How-
ever, her legacy lives on and she continues to
change lives.
The ‘‘Kennedy’s Angel Gowns’’ organization
helps bereaved families who have suffered the
loss of a child before, during, or shortly after
birth. Beautifully handcrafted burial garments
made from donated wedding gowns are pro-
vided along with other resources at no cost. In
addition, the organization provides Cuddle
Cots and Caring Cradles to local hospitals in
the area.
Kennedy’s Angel Gowns continues to raise
awareness of infertility, miscarriage, early neo-
natal loss, stillborn, and infant loss. Many peo-
ple who experience this loss feel very alone
and isolated. The organization’s mission is to
break the silence and offer help.
This year, Hampton Roads will have its first-
ever ‘‘Butterfly Suite,’’ which will officially open
at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital the week
of her 10th Birthday. This dedicated grieving
room will be equipped with a Cuddle Cot or
Caring Cradle, allowing the family to spend
more time with their infant.
I commend Kennedy’s parents for chan-
neling their grief to help others through the
healing process by creating this resource.

practiced in the areas of personal injury, com-
mercial litigation, and civil rights. Prior to en-
tering private practice, Mr. Fass served as the
Kings County prosecutor in Brooklyn, New
York and successfully pursued the rights of
countless personal injury victims, including
abused and neglected elderly individuals.
Joel was a champion for our community’s
elderly. He served as past president of the
Broward County Area Agency on Aging Board
of Directors, and was recently named to the
‘‘Broward Senior Hall of Fame.’’ I have known
few people who worked as tirelessly as Joel
did to ensure our seniors were safe, and able
to maintain their dignity and wellbeing.
Joel was always on the front lines in re-
sponding to the critical needs in our commu-
nity. In 2010, Mr. Fass was bestowed the
‘‘Ending Abuse Award’’ by Broward Jewish
Family Services for his recognition to urge ad-
vocacy of shared gender responsibility in
maintaining domestic tranquility among fami-
lies in the Jewish community.
A resident of Weston, Florida for 19 years,
he chaired the City of Weston’s first Charter
Review Commission and subsequently served
as a Weston Charter Review Commissioner.
Joel was a distinguished veteran who served
honorably in the United States Army and em-
bodied the best of what it means to give back
to your country and community. My heart goes
out to his wife Susan, children, and grand-
children whom he adored and were the light of
his life.
Joel was a selfless, compassionate, and a
tireless advocate for others in Broward Coun-
ty. He will be profoundly missed but never for-
gotten.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF
MILTON QUON
HON. TED LIEU
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to celebrate the life and work of Mr.
Milton Quon, who passed away at the age of
105 on June 18, 2019 in Torrance, California.
Milton was a renowned artist capturing the
transformation of Los Angeles through the
decades and one of the first Chinese Amer-
ican animators hired by Walt Disney Studios.
Born on August 22, 1913 in Los Angeles to
Chinese immigrants from Canton province,
Milton was the oldest of eight children and the
only boy. He had a deep love of drawing from
a young age, one that was nurtured by an
uncle.
Milton attended the Chouinard Art Institute,
now known as Cal Arts, on scholarship. The
pressure to contribute financially to the family
lay with Milton as the eldest child, but the ex-
pectation increased with the death of his fa-
ther and the onset of the Great Depression.
One of Milton’s first jobs as a young artist
was designing menus for various restaurants
in Los Angeles’ Chinatown and other products,
including business cards, chopstick instruc-
tions, and signage, some of which eventually
were declared historic landmarks.
Walt Disney Studios hired Milton in 1939 as
its third Chinese-American animator; he
worked on the ‘‘Waltz of the Flowers’’ and
‘‘Arabian Dance’’ segments of Fantasia and
was first assistant animator on Dumbo. Milton
took a brief hiatus from Disney to assist with
the effort in World War II, illustrating parts
catalogs for military planes and designing a
logo for United China Relief, which raised
funds to help communities in China during the
conflict.
In 1951, Milton became the first Chinese-
American art director at international adver-
tising agency BBDO. He worked there for 13
years before becoming senior design artist at
the packaging firm Sealright Co.
Milton married his wife, Peggy, in 1944 after
they met at a Christian camp in Stockton, Cali-
fornia. His children attested to his love for
teaching, always providing pointers and advice
for his learning students. Milton also taught
drawing, painting, and advertising classes at
Los Angeles Trade and Technical College
from 1974 to 1989.
Milton’s art sought to capture his adventures
in New York, London, and China, but mostly
every day life in Los Angeles. Los Angeles’
transformation was paralleled by one in his
own art, gradually shifting from outlined and
filled with bold colors to more abstract shades
of pastel.
Even in his elder years, Milton’s work was
recognized time and time again: in 2012, as
one of five Chinese-American artists pre-
sented at the Vincent Price Art Museum in
Monterey Park; in 2013, with the Golden Spike
Award from the Chinese Historical Society of
Southern California; and in 2017, with the
Historymakers Award for Excellence in the
Arts from the Chinese American Museum.
Milton is survived by his widow, Peggy; chil-
dren, Mike, Jeff, Tim, and Sherrill; and four
grandchildren. May his memory live on in the
timelessness of his art and his contributions to
the community.

proudly serves the West Michigan community.
Eagle Alloy is a company that provides var-
ious types of advanced metal castings to a va-

1979, the Eagle Alloy headquarters and it’s
manufacturing facilities have all been located
in Muskegon, Michigan, and has become one
of the largest private employers in the commu-

The founders of Eagle Alloy, Mark Fazakerly
and John Workman, are two individuals I
proudly call close friends and have always
held a customer-first attitude when running
their business. In fact, Mark and John still
work closely with their very first customer even
after 40 successful years.
Safety and worker satisfaction are also key
components to the Eagle Alloy workplace.
Eagle Alloy will be celebrating an incredible
500,000 consecutive work hours with no acci-
dents alongside their 40th Anniversary.
In 2015, Eagle Alloy was awarded ‘‘Metal
Caster of the Year’’ by the American Foundry
Society. A few years later in 2018, Eagle Alloy
was honored as the ‘‘Michigan Manufacturer
of the Year’’ by the Michigan Manufacturers
Association.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker,
I proudly pause to recognize the City of Pal-
myra, Missouri, celebrating their Bicentennial
this year.
Settled by Mr. Benjamin Vanlandingham in
1818, the City of Palmyra was officially formed
in 1819 and eventually became the county
seat of Marion County. Founded on a natural
rock foundation, early settlers found an end-
less water supply from a clear, sweet spring.
Land donated by Moses and David Bates en-
abled the town to expand and the establish-
ment of the first land office in Northeast Mis-
souri helped spur westward expansion in Mis-
souri. Many residents can trace their roots to
settlers from Kentucky, Virginia, and Ten-
nessee.
Throughout its rich history, the City of Pal-
myra has been home to an all-boys college,
the co-founder of the Pony Express, Broadway
actress Rose Inghram and film actress Jane
Darwell, academy award winner for The
Grapes of Wrath. The city is also the site of
the Palmyra Massacre, an event in which ten
Confederate prisoners were executed as ret-
ribution for the capture of a pro-Union civilian
during the Civil War.
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join
me in recognizing the rich 200-year history of
the City of Palmyra. Though small in size, the
City is rich in history and spirit. I join with the
citizens of Palmyra in celebrating their Bicen-
tennial. I am extremely honored to serve this
great city in the United States Congress.

Fisher’s lifelong commitment to gospel
music was a beacon of light in the Fort Worth
community. An accomplished singer, pianist
and organist, Fisher was well known as a mu-
sician and leader across Dallas and Fort
Worth. Alongside her leadership in several
church choirs throughout the Dallas-Fort

American churches.

REMEMBERING DR. GEORGE
GEORGIEFF
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the life of Dr. George Georgieff, an
American veteran and well-known orthodontist
from Orange County, California.
Born on November 15, 1931, Dr. Georgieff
grew up in Clairton, Pennsylvania. He grad-
uated from Pennsylvania State University in
1953 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in
Chemistry. After graduating, Dr. Georgieff
nobly served his country in the United States
Air Force as a Lieutenant in the Weapons
Specialist Division from 1954 to 1956. After re-
turning to civilian life, Dr. Georgieff expanded
his career by attending the University of Pitts-
burgh School of Dental Medicine, earning his
Doctor of Dental Surgery in 1961. Dr.
Georgieff then earned a Certificate of
Orthodontics in 1963 from the University of
Pennsylvania.
Dr. Georgieff operated a private orthodontic
practice from 1963 until 2012. In that time, Dr.
Georgieff served more than 25,000 clients. Of
that impressive client base, over 1,500 were
surgical cases. Additionally, Dr. Georgieff was
on staff at St. Joseph, a prestigious hospital in
the City of Orange, from 1965 to 1984 as an
oral surgery consultant and assistant in oral
surgery procedures. A lifelong academic, Dr.
Georgieff lectured on orthodontics across the
United States, as well as in London, England;
Sophia, Bulgaria; and Belgrade, Serbia on be-
half of the American Association of
Orthodontics.
In addition to his hands-on work in his prac-
tice, Dr. Georgieff also worked with various or-
ganizations to enhance the professional com-
munity of orthodontics in Orange County. Dr.
Georgieff was a longtime member of the Or-
ange County Dental Society, where he served
as Program Director from 1970 to 1972 and
the Press Relations Chairman in 1973.
Given his outstanding professional career, it
is no surprise that Dr. Georgieff received nu-
merous prestigious accolades. Dr. Georgieff
became certified through the American Board
of Orthodontics in 1977, becoming the second
orthodontist in Orange County to earn this
achievement. In 1981, Dr. Georgieff received
the Man of the Year Award from the City of
Hope Foundation for outstanding service to
the community. In 1984, Dr. Georgieff was
named the Distinguished Alumnus of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medi-
cine. Most significantly, Dr. Georgieff was
named the top provider of orthodontic treat-
ment for children receiving ‘‘Denti-Cal’’ in the
State of California.
Dr. Georgieff lived a rich and vibrant life
filled with countless professional achievements
and personal fulfillment. Dr. Georgieff is sur-
vived by his wife, Joyce, as well as his three
children, Stephanie, Evan, and Adam, and two
grandchildren, Olivia and Wesley. Dr.
Georgieff will continue to be an inspiration,
personally and professionally, to many. I ask
my colleagues to join me in celebrating the life
of Dr. George Georgieff.

Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, it gives me
great pleasure to congratulate the Salt Bay
Chamberfest on their 25th Anniversary Sea-
son.
Founded in 1994 by cellist Wilhelmina
Smith, the festival has grown to international
recognition. Giving voice to contemporary
composers, the Chamberfest commissions
and premieres new works as well as standard
chamber music. Their mission to ‘‘produce
chamber music of the top artistic quality’’

I am proud of Salt Bay Chamberfest’s com-
mitment to Maine’s Midcoast community
through their education programs—from open
rehearsals to the public and the Family Con-
cert aimed at introducing classical music to fu-
ture generations, to Pre-Concert Talks and
OffTopic! lectures and demonstrations by indi-
vidual musicians. Chamberfest strives to make
music accessible to all ages and ‘‘broadens
the horizons of its audience and the commu-
nity.’’
The arts are essential and play a vital role
in our state’s quality of life. As our creative
economy grows and receives national atten-
tion, I am pleased to recognize Salt Bay
Chamberfest as an exceptional example of
how the arts can enliven and inspire a com-
munity.

SAFE FROM THE START ACT OF
2019
HON. GRACE MENG
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
announce the introduction of the Safe from the
Start Act of 2019. This bill will reduce
incidences of gender-based violence (GBV);
ensure quality services for survivors from the
very onset of emergencies through timely and
effective humanitarian action; and promote
standards for prevention, mitigation and re-
sponse to such crises.
The largest flow of refugees in recorded his-
tory are being forced from their home coun-
tries and their time spent displaced has in-
creased from years to generations. Climate
change continues to spur temporary and per-
manent displacement, as floods and fires de-
stroy homes and livelihoods.
During times of crisis, GBV increases as
chaos and tensions within households and
communities grow. An estimated I in 5 women
in conflict settings have experienced sexual vi-
olence, although numbers are likely higher
given the barriers associated with disclosure.
GBV is often used by armed actors as an in-
timidation tactic to exert power and control
over the opposing side.
Gaps in services and humanitarian protec-
tion frameworks have made it difficult to ade-
quately prevent GBV in humanitarian contexts
and mitigate its impact. Humanitarian agencies
are often underequipped to address GBV spe-
cifically or close gaps between services and
accountability that have led directly to GBV,
such as the exploitation of women in ex-
change for supplies by aid workers. To ad-
dress this, the humanitarian donor community
has begun investing in the building standards,
guidelines, and capacities of humanitarian ac-
tors to better respond to the needs of women
and girls in emergencies.
The Safe from the Start Act would support
the State Department and USAID’s ongoing
work to protect and prevent violence against
women and girls in humanitarian emergencies
by codifying it, and providing Congressional
oversight over its implementation.
I want to thank my colleagues, Representa-
tives CHRIS STEWART, LOIS FRANKEL, MARIO
DIAZ-BALART, and CHRISSY HOULAHAN for lead-
ing this bill with me. I urge the rest of my col-
leagues to support this bill and look forward to
its enactment.

EXPANDING FINDINGS FOR FED-
ERAL OPIOID RESEARCH AND
TREATMENT ACT
SPEECH OF
HON. TROY BALDERSON
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 23, 2019
Mr. BALDERSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
in support of H.R. 3153, the Expanding Find-
ings for Federal Opioid Research and Treat-
ment, or EFFORT Act. This bill is of particular
importance to me, as I represent an area that
has been devastated by the opioid crisis over
the past decade, and I am privileged to speak
today on the important of this bill.
In my home state of Ohio, the rate of opioid-
related deaths is more than double the na-
tional average. In this regard, Ohio ranks as
one of the top-five states with the highest
rates of opioid-related deaths. What’s more
alarming, however, is the rate at which the
number of opioid overdoses have increased:
twenty-eight percent from July 2016 through
September 2017. That’s barely more than a
year during which opioid overdoses grew by
nearly thirty percent. These statistics should
terrify every parent, sibling, teacher, caregiver,
and friend, because opioid addiction is not

confined to any one geographic, socio-
economic, or other type of demographic. Rath-
er, this epidemic is ravaging communities all
around our country.
How did this epidemic start? Let’s go back
to 2012, when there were more opioid pre-
scriptions in my home state of Ohio than there
were people. Prescriptions to opioids were
handed out like candy, and there was little-to-
no regulation on these highly-addictive drugs.
Someone could sustain a simple injury—say,
to their knee or their back—perhaps even
have surgery, and be prescribed highly-addict-
ive opioids for their pain. With no oversight,
Americans everywhere were slowly becoming
addicted to these substances, with their toler-
ance levels increasing, therefore requiring
them to take higher doses to experience the
same level of pain relief. Of course, these
drugs are not cheap. Often times, when the
drugs become too costly or a prescription ran
out, these now-addicted opioid users would
turn to street drugs, such as heroin, to feed
their addiction. In Ohio, four out of five heroin
addicts began their drug use with prescription
painkillers.
Often times, once an addiction starts, it’s
near impossible to break the cycle. Truly, the
best way to treat addiction is to stop it before
it even starts. Of course, we know now that
opioid addiction is completely preventable, and
fighting this growing epidemic will take the
work of many committed groups. This multi-
faceted crisis needs the support of police de-
partments, communities, families and schools,
government at all levels, and the medical and
science communities. That’s where the EF-
FORT Act comes in.
This critical piece of legislation will direct the
National Science Foundation to study the ef-
fects of the opioid epidemic and will require
this body to consult with the National Institute
of Health—and vice versa—in their research
of opioid addiction. I’m a firm believer that re-
search is one of the most important tools in
fighting illnesses like addiction. Of course, this
is just one of many pieces in the vast puzzle
of putting an end to the opioid epidemic. This
bill is a step in the right direction, and we
need to continue our efforts to fight this epi-
demic. I am proud to cosponsor the EFFORT
Act, and I thank my colleague from Virginia,
Congresswoman JENNIFER WEXTON for intro-
ducing this critical legislation. I urge my col-
leagues to pass H.R. 3153 so our country can
better prevent opioid addiction.

HON. ANN M. KUSTER
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor Andrew Lavoie,
Chief of the Nashua Police Department, for his
service and leadership to the Department for
32 years, the last four and a half years as
Chief.
Over the span of Chief Lavoie’s career, he
has taken on numerous roles within the Nash-
ua Police Department, whether it was attack-
ing the opioid crisis from the law enforcement
perspective by making many arrests or stand-
ing with his community to protect and serve.
Chief Lavoie has been a leading and re-
spected voice in the Granite State advocating
for the Safe Station Program and forming the
Nashua Community Conversations on Race
and Justice, which have enhanced relation-
ships between police and Nashua’s diverse
population amongst other accomplishments. I
commend Chief Lavoie on his retirement after
three decades of work in public service.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s Second Congressional District, con-
gratulations to Chief Andrew Lavoie for a well-
deserved retirement. I thank him for his serv-
ice and wish him the very best in the years to
come.

CELEBRATING THE ROBINSON
WESTBROOKS FAMILY 109TH
FAMILY REUNION
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize the Robinson
Westbrooks family who will be celebrating
their 109th family reunion in Los Angeles,
California on August 16–18, 2019. Each year,
the Robinson Westbrooks family gets together
for the oldest ongoing registered family re-
union in the United States.
It all started with Mr. John Bolin Robinson,
Mrs. Dora Anne Westbrooks Robinson, and
their youngest child, Leonard Wilbert Robin-
son, who all share a birthday of August 16.
Their coinciding birthdays led to the tradition
of getting the family together every third Sun-
day in August to celebrate family unity and the
blessings of God. The first official Robinson
Westbrooks Family Reunion was held on Au-
gust 16, 1910 in Eclectic, Alabama, making
this year the 109th celebration.
The Robinson Westbrooks family makes the
most out of their annual family gatherings
throughout the United States. They are reg-
istered at the United States Library of Con-
gress.
This year the family celebrates their oldest
family members, Mrs. Queenie Elizabeth
Thompson-Hunter, age 93, of Detroit, Michi-
gan, Mrs. Clara Dora Thompson-Smith, age
92, of Detroit, Michigan, and Mr. Charlie An-
derson Brown, age 96, of Eclectic, Alabama.
On behalf of the 7th Congressional District
of Alabama, I extend best wishes to the
Westbrooks family. I hope this tradition con-
tinues for many years to come.

HONORING CAPTAIN AARON
HATTABAUGH AND OPERATION
SENIOR SURPRISE
HON. ADAM KINZINGER
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize my constituent, Aaron
Hattabaugh, a retired captain and B–52 navi-
gator, for taking part in the longest combat
mission in Air Force history.
On January 16, 1991, Captain Hattabaugh
and fifty-six other airmen aboard seven B–52G
aircraft of the 596th Bombardment Squadron
took off from Barksdale Air Force Base, Lou-
isiana on Operation Senior Surprise. However,
those who took part named their mission Op-
eration Secret Squirrel.
This was the United States’ first move to lib-
erate Kuwait from Saddam Hussein. Using
state of the art air launched cruise missiles,
these brave airmen had one objective: to de-
stroy Hussein’s strategic assets in Iraq and
Kuwait. Over the course of this mission, the
aircraft destroyed nearly all of the targets and
blinded the Iraqi military to our ground forces,
in turn saving countless American lives. In-
credibly, these aircraft completed four in-air re-
fueling maneuvers and covered 14,000 nau-
tical miles in under 36 hours.
This year marks the 28th anniversary of
‘‘Operation Secret Squirrel’’ and each year,
those involved in this historic mission gather to
remember their piece of history made. In the
longest mission since the Doolittle Raids on
Japan, these aviators carried out their mission
with honor and bravery.
Madam Speaker, those who served on this
mission displayed true endurance and dedica-
tion to country in their actions. It is my honor
to recognize Captain Hattabaugh and the fifty-
six others who took part in this critical mission.

‘‘MAYOR OF MADISON STREET’’
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, I take this opportunity to pay tribute
to one of my constituents, and a personal
friend, Mr. Randy Corbin who migrated from
Arkansas, came to Chicago and established a
business and lived a wonderfully productive
life. Randy grew up in Gould, Arkansas, came
to Chicago, attended Worsham College of
Mortuary Science. Married his queen, Karen
Kennedy and they raised four children, two
sons Amell and Loren, two daughters
Clarressa and Syreeta. He served in the U.S.
Army, and was honorably discharged in 1964.
Randy started his career as a janitor at AA
Rayner Funeral Home and worked his way
through the ranks with successive promotions.
In 1977, Randy partnered with a friend, Lu-
ther Sparks and they started the Luther
Sparks Funeral Home. Unfortunately, Mr.
Sparks died and Randy became the sole pro-
prietor and the rest became history. Randy
built a successful business, was generously
supportive of community activities. He started
other business ventures, provided leadership
to the community and earned the title, ‘‘Mayor
of Madison Street’’. Randy was a member of
the Illinois Funeral Directors Association, a
leadership member of the Boy Scouts of
America, he sponsored local basketball teams
and students pursing education. He hosted
school supply drives, donated volumes of sup-
plies to youth and families throughout the
years. He regularly donated to churches and
let ministers use Corbin Chapel for services.
He is survived by his wife Karen and their four
children, his sister, fourteen grandchildren, five
great grandchildren, a host of nieces, neph-
ews, cousins and friends.

BIPARTISAN BUDGET ACT OF 2019
SPEECH OF
HON. RICHARD E. NEAL
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 25, 2019
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, last week the
Democrats helped secure a strong bipartisan
budget agreement that includes suspending
the debt limit until July 31, 2021.
The measure ensures that we will avoid a
default on the full faith and credit of the United
States and can follow through on our financial
obligations.
All of us were elected to help America’s
working-class families. This agreement is an-
other tool to help them. In particular, it sets
the stage for responsible budgeting and ends
sequestration. It also includes funding for an
accurate census, veterans, Child Care Devel-
opment Block Grants, tools to address the
opioid epidemic, and increases in NIH funding.
Extending the debt limit keeps our nation’s
finances on stable ground—unlike what the
Republicans did in 2011, 2013 and 2015. I ap-
plaud the Speaker and all our colleagues in-
volved in crafting this measure, and I encour-
age everyone to support it. A ‘yes’ vote is re-
sponsible, provides certainty to our nation’s
markets, and delivers stability to Americans’
retirement savings as well as our nation’s
economy.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND
SERVICE OF KEN BEHRING
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the life and service of long-
time Danville resident, Mr. Ken Behring.
Mr. Behring was born June 13, 1928 in
Freeport, Illinois. He spent his youth on his
family’s farm during the Great Depression. By
twenty-one Ken had opened the doors to his
first business, Behring Motors, a used car
dealership in Monroe, Illinois. Six years later,
Mr. Behring had grown his small dealership to
have $1 million dollars in assets.
After relocating to Florida, Ken began work
developing communities. By the early 1970s
having cemented himself as one of the na-
tion’s most successful developers, he moved
to California and purchased a four-thousand-
acre tract of land near Danville. After donating
almost half of the land to the Mount Diablo
State Park, Ken molded the remaining 2,500
acres into the nationally renowned Blackhawk
housing development. Ken’s design for
Blackhawk helped establish the standard for
upscale development design nationwide.
Eventually, Ken created additional develop-
ments resulting in over seven thousand new
homes and contributing to the growth of East
Contra Costa County.
In addition to Ken’s housing development
career, he was an active philanthropist. Mil-
lions of Mr. Behring’s earnings have been do-
nated to universities, museums and charities
across the country, including the largest single
donation ever to the Smithsonian Museums. In
2000, Mr. Behring founded The Wheelchair
Foundation as a branch of the Behring Global
Health and Education Foundation. In its first
six years, the foundation provided wheelchairs
to individuals in 144 countries and reached
one million wheelchairs donated in 2015.
Ken Behring was a cherished member of
the Contra Costa Community and he will be
missed.

HONORING SANTA ANA ELKS
LODGE NO. 794
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to celebrate the 117th anniversary of the
Santa Ana Elks Lodge No. 794 and the grand
opening of their third Lodge.
The Santa Ana Elks Lodge was formed in
1902 by William L. Tubbs and several busi-
nessmen from the city. Mr. Tubbs was pre-
viously a member of the Lodge in Council
Bluffs, Iowa before to moving to Santa Ana.
On June 2, 1902, the Santa Ana chapter
was granted dispensation by the Grand Lodge
to form the Lodge. When he was installed as
the first Exalted Ruler on July 14, 1902, Mr.
Tubbs became the ‘‘Father’’ of the Santa Ana
Elks Lodge. The Lodge was issued its Charter
on August 14, 1902. The Lodge was first lo-
cated in McFadden Hall until October 20,
1902, when they moved to the Odd Fellows
Hall. The Lodge relocated to the Hervey Build-
ing at Fourth and Spurgeon Street on May 18,
1903. This is also where the first Flag Day ob-
servance was held on June 14, 1907. In Sep-
tember 1907, in need of room to expand, the
Lodge bought a fifty-foot lot. On March 14,
1911 they moved to this location at Sycamore
and Sixth Street. The Lodge remained there
until April 2, 1961, when they opened a brand-
new Lodge at 212 Elk Lane. The Lodge cele-
brated their 100th anniversary at this location
in 2002.
Finally, in April of 2018, the Elks Lodge tem-
porarily moved to downtown Santa Ana until
the completion of their current location at 1751
S. Lyon Street. Exalted Ruler Dan Breece, his
wife and First Lady, Sharon Breece, and his
Officers held their first Elks event on June 15,
2019. The Inaugural Ball was attended by 730
members and guests including the incoming
Grand Exalted Ruler.
The Santa Ana Elks Lodge is known as the
‘‘Mother Lodge’’ for all of Orange County and
has a rich and unique history. Santa Ana Elks
No. 794 are active members of the commu-
nity. They host a school supply drive for Santa
Ana and Tustin schools and fund raising for
special needs students with their ‘‘Purple Pig’’
program.
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize
Santa Ana Elks Lodge No. 794 for their con-
tributions to our community and I congratula-
tion them on the opening of their new Lodge.
TRIBUTE TO STAFF SERGEANT
ODON S. CARDENAS
HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker,
today I rise in honor of WWII Veteran, Retired
Army Staff Sergeant Odon S. Cardenas. July
30, 2019 marks SSgt. Cardenas 100th birth-
day and I am proud to represent an individual
who has dedicated his life to family, commu-
nity, and country.
SSgt. Odon Cardenas was born on July 30,
1919 in Devine, Texas to Donaciano and
Cecilia Cardenas. One of six siblings, his early
life was spent as a Sugar Beet Farmer in
Shakopee, Minnesota. On March 29, 1941 he
enlisted in the United States Army in Ft.
Snelling, Minnesota as Private First Class.
After becoming Squad Leader, SSG Odon
Cardenas was assigned to the 172nd Bat-
talion, Company C in California. Shortly after
reassignment, the battalion deployed in No-
vember 1944 to the Mediterranean Theater of
Operations of World War II in Germany.
While on the front lines of defense,
Cardenas and his unit were attacked by Ger-
man opposition. During the ambush, his com-
pany received heavy artillery fire. Approxi-
mately 24 hours into battle, he and a few oth-
ers attempted to escape by crawling through
the snow at night. However, he and several
company members were captured by opposi-
tion forces and held in captivity at a Prisoner-
of-War camp near Dusseldorf, Germany. After
being detained for two weeks, SSgt. Cardenas
and his fellow service members were liberated
by the Americans and allied forces. Odon de-
parted soon after in April 1945, receiving an
honorable discharge in October 1945.
After the war, SSgt. Cardenas became a
barber and auto mechanic. With his wife of 60
years, Maria Inez Valadez Cardenas, they
raised 10 children along with 18 grandchildren,
30 great grandchildren, and 4 great-great
grandchildren. Madam Speaker, I am honored
to represent SSgt. Odon Cardenas and look
forward to his 100th birthday. His lifelong dedi-
cation to our country can only be met with

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT
OF COLUMBIA BRIDGES HOME
RULE ACT
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Bridges Home
Rule Act. This bill would repeal a redundant
1997 federal law that makes it a crime for a
person in the District of Columbia to obstruct
any bridge connecting D.C. and Virginia. The
District already had, and continues to have, its
own local law prohibiting obstructing a bridge
in the District. There is no federal law that pro-
hibits a person in Virginia from obstructing
such a bridge or a person in any state from
obstructing a bridge connecting two states,
and, fortunately, D.C. does not need a federal
law to keep our bridges clear either.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1013
July 30, 2019
This law is as offensive as it is redundant.
It harks back to a time when a private group
in D.C. attempted to block the 14th Street
Bridge into Virginia, although there is no evi-
dence that D.C. authorities failed to act. The
District’s local criminal law prohibiting obstruct-
ing a bridge takes care of any obstruction oc-
curring here.
Under the 1997 federal law, ‘‘whoever in the
District of Columbia knowingly and willfully ob-
structs any bridge connecting the District of
Columbia and the Commonwealth of Virginia
. . . shall be fined not less than $1,000 and
not more than $5,000, and in addition may be
imprisoned not more than 30 days. . . .’’
Under D.C. law, a person may be subject to
imprisonment and/or fines for ‘‘crowd[ing],
obstruct[ing], or incommod[ing] . . . [t]he use
of any street, avenue, alley, road, highway, or
sidewalk.’’
The courts have long held that D.C. may re-
peal federal laws that predate the 1973 Home
Rule Act (HRA) and apply exclusively in or to
the District, but have not ruled on whether
D.C. may repeal post-HRA federal laws that
apply exclusively in or to the District. My bill
would avoid any court challenge the District
could face if it tries to repeal this 1997 federal
law.
This is an important step to increase home
rule for the District, and I urge my colleagues
to support this bill.

HON. MARC A. VEASEY
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to commemorate the life of Reverend L.S. Wil-
son of the East Saint Paul Baptist Church, an
important member of our community in Fort
Worth, Texas.
Born on March 2, 1936, Pastor Wilson im-
pacted our community in unique and profound
ways. Pastor Wilson grew up attending Fort
Worth public schools where he graduated from
I.M. Terrell High School in 1955. He later went
on to earn a Bachelor of Arts Degree from
Dallas Baptist University and a Master of Edu-
cation Degree in Administration from Texas
A&M University at Commerce.
Pastor Wilson began his ministry in 1971
and led several congregations in North Texas
for over forty years. From Elam Grove Baptist
Church in Mabank, Texas to Bethlehem Bap-
tist Church in Bonham, Texas, Reverend Wil-
son was eventually called to become the Pas-
tor of East St. Paul Baptist Church in Fort
Worth, Texas in 2001 where he served until
his death in 2019. Pastor Wilson took on
many leadership roles in churches across the
North Texas community where his legacy will
never be forgotten.
I want to take this opportunity to extend my
thoughts and prayers to the Pastor Wilson’s
family and community. He was a man who al-
ways put, God, family, and community first. He
did so much for our Fort Worth community,
and I want to give a special thanks to him for
making our community a better place.

Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, it is with
great respect that I rise today to celebrate the
twentieth anniversary of the Carbon County
Fair.
Since its reestablishment in 1999, the Car-
bon County Fair has celebrated the best of
our communities and our rich agricultural tradi-
tion. We owe a great deal of gratitude to the
local Lion and Lioness Clubs for supporting
this annual community event. For five days in
August, the fair welcomes community mem-
bers to a variety of exhibitions showcasing the
area’s agricultural and industrial achieve-
ments. The fair brings neighbors together for
exhibitions, fireworks, races, and the annual
tractor pull. The Carbon County Fair plays an
outstanding role in celebrating the importance
of agriculture and industry in our communities.
On behalf of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives and the citizens of Pennsylvania’s Ninth
Congressional District, I ask my colleagues to
join me in congratulating the Carbon County
Fair on twenty incredible years celebrating our
communities. May this tradition continue for
many years to come.

U.S. SENATOR JOSEPH D. TYDINGS
MEMORIAL PREVENT ALL
SORING TACTICS ACT OF 2019
SPEECH OF
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, July 24, 2019
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
support of H.R. 693, the U.S. Senator Joseph
D. Tydings Memorial Prevent All Soring Tac-
tics Act of 2019 or the ‘‘PAST’’ Act.
Put simply, soring is the cruel practice of in-
tentionally inflicting pain on a horse’s legs or
hooves to alter the horse’s gait. This is done
by applying caustic chemicals such as diesel
fuel, and mustard oil to the skin, and inserting
sharp painful objects into horses’ hooves to
achieve an artificial high-stepping gait. It is all
too commonly inflicted on horses that partici-
pate in Tennessee Walking Horse competi-
tions.
As a former horse owner myself, I am deep-
ly disturbed about the pain and suffering these
majestic animals are put through. Soring is al-
ready prohibited by the laws of the United
States. Congress passed the Horse Protection
Act in 1970 to address the problem. What we
are doing today is identifying gaps in the origi-
nal law and fixing them.
No other category of horse show has fed-
eral oversight because no other group of train-
ers and horse show enthusiasts intentionally
injure horses as a way to enhance perform-
ance. This practice belongs in the same cat-
egory as dogfighting and cockfighting in that
people hurt animals in severe ways just for
entertainment. Ending this despicable practice
is long overdue.
Since the PAST Act was first introduced in
the 113th Congress it has never had fewer
than 272 cosponsors and has always been a
firmly bipartisan bill with co-sponsors rep-
resenting districts across the country. The
PAST Act is also supported by hundreds of
veterinary and equine groups—including the
veterinary medical associations from all 50
states. I would like to recognize the hard work
of the individuals within these outside animal
rights advocates—particularly Marty Irby, Ex-
ecutive Director of Animal Wellness Action,
who has dedicated so many years to this pur-
pose.
As the chair of the subcommittee where this
bill is assigned, I am proud to stand in favor
of this anti-cruelty legislation. Let’s send the
bill to the Senate with a strong vote that
shows how Americans will not stand for ani-
mal abuse.

would like to add that there are several provi-
sions contained in H.R. 3409 to ensure that
the Coast Guard stays on the cutting edge of
readiness. I appreciated the inclusion of the
Coast Guard Shore Infrastructure Improve-
ment Act, which I introduced with my col-
league, Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL of Florida.
This legislation will ensure that the $2.6 billion
backlog of shore infrastructure needs are
prioritized strategically so that our Coasties
have the high-quality on-shore facilities to sup-
port their numerous missions.
I also want to thank Mr. DEFAZIO and Mr.
MALONEY for working with my staff to include
in H.R. 3409 a provision to prepare a dem-
onstration program for the use of wing-in-
ground vessels in the Outer Continental Shelf.
Mr. Speaker, this provision emphasizes the
dramatic advancements in new transportation
technologies over the past few years and
urges the Coast Guard to begin preparing to
oversee their use. A demonstration program
will support the Coast Guard in conceptual-
izing how these new technologies will be used
to support commerce in U.S. waters and how
such vessels will be regulated. We cannot wait
for these technologies to be fully matured be-
fore we contemplate their safe application in
our waters or airspace. Again, I appreciate the
inclusion of these provisions in the underlying
authorization and support its adoption.

AMERICAN MANUFACTURING
LEADERSHIP ACT
SPEECH OF
HON. TROY BALDERSON
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 23, 2019
Mr. BALDERSON. Mr. Speaker, I am a
proud original cosponsor of Research and
Technology Subcommittee Chairwoman Haley
Stevens’ bill, the American Manufacturing
Leadership Act because our nation’s economy
relies on the manufacturing industry and must

prioritize policies that strengthen it. In my
home state of Ohio, the manufacturing indus-
try accounts for 16.6 percent of total output,
and employs 12.5 percent of our workforce, or
690,200 employees. All told, the manufac-
turing produced $107.95 billion worth of output
in Ohio in 2017 and continues to grow each
day.
H.R. 2397 would strengthen our nation’s
largest investment in advanced manufac-
turing—the Manufacturing USA Program—
which has thrived in the past seven years
since its creation and build on that success to
strengthen our manufacturing workforce. This
bill would reauthorize the successful Revitalize
American Manufacturing and Innovation of
2014 and extend it to all agencies sponsoring
centers for manufacturing innovation, allowing
more of those that invest in manufacturing to
benefit from this program. It would further
strengthen the institutes’ role in advanced
manufacturing workforce development—some-
thing I’m deeply passionate about—along with
outreach to and inclusion of small- and me-
dium-sized businesses, which are vital to a
prosperous American economy.
H.R. 2397 also puts important checks, bal-
ances, and oversight into place by encour-
aging the program office to develop pilot pro-
grams for the institutes, as well as identify for
and disseminate to them best education and
workforce training practices. It would also ex-
pand Manufacturing USA’s authorities to col-
laborate with other agencies, including to de-
velop network-wide performance goals. In ad-
dition, while this bill would authorize agencies
to renew institutes for an additional period of
funding, allowing those institutes to meet their
ultimate goals, this would only be allowed fol-
lowing a rigorous review of the institute’s
progress toward meeting measurable goals.
The manufacturing industry is a pillar of the
American economy and drives many of the
other industries that make up our country’s an-
nual GDP. Without the manufacturing industry,
the American economy would cease to exist.
H.R. 2397 would expand on manufacturing
programs with proven success and accelerate
our nation’s progress in advanced manufac-
turing. Ultimately, this legislation leverages ex-
isting programs across the federal government
to help Manufacturing USA Institutes achieve
its goals. Finally, as an advocate for small
business and workforce development, I’m ex-
cited that this bill expands to include more
small- and medium-sized manufacturers, since
they are the lifeblood of our nation’s economy.
Once again, I thank my colleague from
Michigan for her leadership on this legislation,
and I urge the committee’s support of H.R.
2397.

LIFE AND MEMORY OF KATHY
TEAL
HON. KEN BUCK
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the life and memory of Kathy Teal.
Kathy was born in Newark, NJ and grew up
in the Chicago suburb of Wheaton, IL. A cer-
tified midwife, she devoted herself to serving
unwed mothers and children. Kathy was a
founding member of both Birthright of Greeley

ant mothers in Colorado and continually sup-
ported organizations that protect the sanctity
of life, including the Weld County Right to Life.
Madam Speaker, it is an honor to recognize
Kathy Teal for always fighting to protect those
unable to protect themselves. On behalf of the
Fourth Congressional District of Colorado, I
extend my condolences to the Teal family and
my gratitude to Kathy for her life of service.

Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker,
I proudly pause to recognize Meierhoffer Fu-
neral Home and Crematory in St. Joseph, Mis-
souri, as it celebrates its 125th anniversary.
For one hundred twenty-five years and five
generations, the Meierhoffer Family has been
there for people. For grieving families, for wid-
ows and children, Meierhoffer Funeral Home
has been there. The Meierhoffers, with kind-
ness, empathy and a quiet presence are able
to bring calm to the chaos of raw nerves and
frayed emotions. They are able to help others
make peace and help families begin the proc-
ess of healing from a loss. People say that
having a good funeral home is like having a
good lawyer. You never want to have to call
them, but when you do have to make that call,
you are always glad that they are there. I and
all of St. Joseph, are eternally grateful that for
over a century the Meierhoffer Funeral Home
has been there.
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join
me in recognizing Meierhoffer Funeral Home
and Crematory for one hundred twenty-five
years of serving the people of St. Joseph, Mis-
souri. I am honored to have such a long-
standing family business in the Sixth Congres-
sional District of Missouri and to represent the
Meierhoffer Family in the United States Con-

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND
SERVICE OF DIANE LORENZETTI
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the life and service of long-
time Concord resident, Diane Lorenzetti.
Diane, affectionately known as ‘‘Miss
Diane,’’ was born in Concord, California in
1943 to loving parents Ettore and Emily
Lorenzetti. While attending Holy Names Col-
lege, Diane worked part-time as a pre-school
teacher for the City of Concord. In 1974, she
left the classroom and became the Director of
the Concord Senior Center.
Over the next 29 years, Diane worked tire-
lessly to ensure a pleasant and engaging ex-
perience for all visiting seniors. It is said that
she made the center feel like a second home
and challenged herself to remember the
names of everyone she met. During her ten-
ure as Director, Diane was an important and
reliable figure in the Concord senior commu-
nity.
As the executive producer of the Concord
Senior Citizen’s Club, Diane directed a num-
ber of shows such as Talent Recycled, which
played to hundreds of fans at the Senior Cen-
ter, the Willows Theatre, and the Concord Pa-
vilion. It was important to Diane to allow the
seniors who participated to express them-
selves creatively and feel a sense of commu-
nity.
On top of her work with the senior commu-
nity, Diane was very active with the Druids of
California and was a member of the local
chapter starting in 1960. She also served as
a member of the Young Ladies institute where
she worked to support the Catholic faith, en-
courage apostolic and charitable works, and
celebrate Italian American heritage.
Diane will be sorely missed, and her lasting
impact will long be remembered in the Con-
cord community.

RECOGNIZING VIET BAO DAILY
NEWS AND WRITING ON AMERICA
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise to
congratulate Viet Bao Daily News for the 20th
anniversary of the Writing on America pro-
gram. Viet Bao Daily News introduced Writing
on America twenty years ago, on April 30,
2000, which marked the 25th anniversary of
the beginning of a new Vietnamese population
in the United States of America.
In the face of adversity, the Vietnamese
community in the U.S. has demonstrated com-
mendable resilience and strength, building a
home for themselves and laying a strong foun-
dation for generations of Vietnamese Ameri-
cans to come. Viet Bao, one of the most well-
respected and widely read sources of Viet-
namese daily news, has become an integral
part of this legacy.
Outside of being a reliable news source for
the Vietnamese community, Viet Bao’s Writing
on America program has fostered the stories
of Vietnamese and Vietnamese American indi-
viduals traversing the negative impacts of the
Vietnam War and the Vietnamese diaspora.
The program hosts an annual writing contest
for the Vietnamese community to submit es-
says on their unique overseas experiences.
The top winners of the contest are given a
monetary award, but all approved submissions
are published daily in Viet Bao and aggre-
gated into a book available for purchase on-
line. These stories attract more than 80,000
readers per year.
The Writing on America program became a
tool of healing for the individuals sharing their
stories and for the individuals who could relate
to their experiences. It is also an archive of Vi-
etnamese history in America, one that is filled
with the grief of leaving one’s home country,
an unrelenting belief in the American dream,
and the hope for a future of happiness and
prosperity. Over time, it has become a forum
for celebrating the achievements and joys of
the Vietnamese community.

family, and revitalization, and uplifting these
stories to a broader audience. I ask that my

HONORING WILLIAM E. ‘‘BILL’’
MCGONAGLE
HON. STEPHEN F. LYNCH
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. LYNCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today in
honor of William E. ‘‘Bill’’ McGonagle, in rec-
ognition of his wonderful service, for over forty
years, on behalf of the City of Boston and the
thousands of families who reside in public
housing in our City.
The son of Jeannette and Daniel
McGonagle, Bill is the third of six children. A
true son of South Boston, Bill spent his early
childhood on Lennon Court in South Boston
and the remainder of his childhood in the Mary
Ellen McCormack housing development in
South Boston (named after Speaker John
McCormack’s mother). Bill attended the Gate
of Heaven Grammar School and High School
prior to his graduation from South Boston High
School.
While Bill is a veteran, having enlisted in the
Naval Reserves and attended University of
Massachusetts at Boston, Bill has had the tre-
mendous good fortune to be married to his
wife Ellen for 47 years. They have been
blessed with three children, Matthew, Mark
and Alyson.
Bill started his career at the Boston Housing
Authority (BHA) in 1981 as a member of
BHA’s Department of Public Safety, where he
worked to combat violence and drug abuse in
public housing. His compassion and work
ethic were quickly recognized by BHA Re-
ceiver Harry Spence and Bill was chosen to
participate in a BHA-sponsored management
training program, which included graduate-
level management classes at the Boston Uni-
versity School of Social Work. Bill was quickly
promoted from a public housing development
manager to area director overseeing the man-
agement of BHA’s thirty-seven elderly and dis-
abled public housing developments throughout
Boston addressing the needs of thousands of
seniors and disabled citizens.
Bill later served as executive assistant to
then BHA Administrator Doris Bunte where he
served as the liaison between the BHA and
residents in the public housing developments
in South Boston and Charlestown. Many resi-
dent leaders have noted that Bill had tremen-
dous credibility and connected with many of
the tenants because of his own upbringing in
public housing. His compassion and under-
standing have earned him the deep and abid-
ing respect of the residents of public housing
as well as the many political leaders who
shared the responsibility for meeting the
needs of residents. While there were some
rough patches in the history of the public
housing developments across Boston, Bill
McGonagle has been the bridge from those
troubled times to today, when the revitalization
of major housing developments is taking place
all across Boston.
Bill was appointed Deputy Administrator on
April 1, 1992. He served in that role for 17
years for three administrators: David Cortiella,
Joseph Feaster, and Sandra Henriquez.
And on June 11, 2009, Mayor Thomas M.
Menino made one of the best decisions in his
long career and appointed Bill as Adminis-
trator for the Boston Housing Authority. And
later, in his infinite wisdom, Mayor Martin J.
Walsh asked Bill to continue in that capacity
as part of his administration, much to the joy
of public housing residents across the City.
Since becoming Administrator, Bill has been
the driving force in the revitalization of many
of the housing developments throughout the
city of Boston, including the Anne M. Lynch
Homes at Old Colony and the transformation
of the Mary Ellen McCormack Development.
Over the years, Bill has been recognized for
his commitment, loyalty and dedication to the
city of Boston and its public housing residents,
receiving the Urban League of Eastern Massa-
chusetts (ULEM) President’s Award, the J.
Lincoln Durand Award from the Massachusetts
Union of Public Housing Tenants and the John
W. McCormack Public Service Award.
Madam Speaker, while Bill is not a person
of many hobbies, he is a rabid Celtics fan in
the greatest Boston tradition. He prides him-
self on being a history buff and amazes all
with his knowledge of American history. Over
the last decade, Bill and Ellen have reveled in
their favorite passion, spoiling their five grand-
children Maggie, Andrew, Lucy, Evelyn and
Calvin.
Alas, not one to go quietly into retirement,
Bill, not only intends to spend time with his
family, he recently earned a certificate in sub-
stance abuse counseling from UMass-Boston
and he plans to work in substance recovery,
continuing his dedication and commitment to
serving others. Just take a moment and think
about that one. Talk about a good guy.
Madam Speaker, Bill leaves a legacy of tire-
lessly working for tenants and breaking down
barriers. It is my distinct honor to take to the
floor of the House today to join with the family
and many friends and the thousands of fami-
lies in public housing and advocates for afford-
able housing all across our Country who want
to say thank you to William E. ‘‘Bill’’
McGonagle for his forty years of remarkable
service to his community of South Boston and
the public housing residents of Boston.

Along with being involved with the Park Dis-
trict, Tim has also served as the acting Chair-
man of the Riverfront Business District Com-
mission. His resolve to be a positive influence
is something we can all be proud of. Our area
is fortunate to have someone so dedicated to
the betterment of our community.
I am grateful for Tim’s time and commitment
to Central Illinois. His work as a public servant
has left a legacy in our community that will re-
main for generations to come.

INTRODUCTION OF THE ARPA-E
REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2019
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker,
today I am very pleased to introduce the
ARPA-E Reauthorization Act of 2019 with my
colleague, Mr. Lamb, who is the Chairman of
the Subcommittee on Energy.
Even though the agency is still relatively
young, ARPA-E has already demonstrated in-
credible success in advancing high-risk, high-
reward energy technology solutions that nei-
ther the public nor the private sector had been
willing or able to support in the past. Industry
leaders like Bill Gates and Norm Augustine
have repeatedly called for tripling this agen-
cy’s budget given the unique role that it is now
playing in our energy innovation pipeline.
ARPA-E’s impressive track record now in-
cludes over $2.9 billion in private sector fol-
low-on funding for a group of 145 ARPA-E
projects since the agency’s founding in 2009.
Equally notable, 76 projects have formed new
companies and 131 projects have shown
enough promise to result in partnerships with
other government agencies for further devel-
opment. Moreover, as of March 2019, ARPA-
E projects have helped advance scientific un-
derstanding and technological innovation
through 2,489 peer-reviewed journal articles
and 346 patents issued by the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office.
Yet to date, ARPA-E has only been able to
support about 1 percent of the proposals sub-
mitted for its open funding opportunities, and
12 percent of the proposals submitted for its
focused programs, even though the number of
promising, high quality proposals that the
agency has received is many times higher.
This is why the ARPA-E Reauthorization Act
of 2019 authorizes substantial growth in fund-
ing for the agency over the next five years.
This growth is consistent with the original rec-
ommendations of the National Academies for
establishing and supporting ARPA-E in its
seminal Rising Above the Gathering Storm re-
port, as well as more recent strong rec-
ommendations from well-respected bipartisan

and nonpartisan institutions such as the Bipar-
tisan Policy Center’s American Energy Innova-
tion Council, the Information Technology and
Innovation Foundation, and the Energy Fu-
tures Initiative.
I’d also note that in its review of the pro-
gram released in June 2017, the National
Academies found that a substantial increase in
funding would be necessary for ARPA-E to be
able to sufficiently support the scale-up of par-
ticularly promising technologies, such as ad-
vanced technologies for energy storage and
power electronics, that were previously sup-
ported by the agency. But many of these new
approaches are still too risky to be supported
by the private sector alone, and too often,
other DOE programs remain ill-suited to stew-
ard them.
So by authorizing these resources, this bill
ensures that ARPA-Eis able to fully pursue the
development and eventual commercialization
of truly transformational clean energy tech-
nologies, just as DARPA, the agency that
ARPA-E is modeled, has been able to dem-
onstrate time and again for defense applica-
tions.
Other improvements in this bill include ex-
plicit authorization for ARPA-E to better ad-
dress DOE’s significant nuclear waste clean-
up and management issues, for which the De-
partment currently spends several billion dol-
lars every year attempting to manage with cur-
rent technologies. And it includes authorization
for ARPA-E to support projects to improve the
resilience, reliability, and security of our en-
ergy infrastructure.
The ARPA-E Reauthorization Act of 2019
incorporates extensive feedback from stake-
holders, as well as input we received during a
hearing the Committee on Science, Space,
and Technology held on February 26th entitled
The Future of ARPA-E. It also incorporates
constructive language from a bill that I co-
sponsored with my friend, Mr. Lucas, who is
now Ranking Member of the Committee, last
year.
This bill is endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, the National Association of Manu-
facturers (NAM), the Council on Competitive-
ness, the Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC), the
Association of American Universities (AAU),
the Association of Public & Land-grant Univer-
sities (APLU), the Nuclear Energy Institute
(NEI), the American Gas Association (AGA),
the Energy Storage Association (ESA), the
Carbon Utilization Research Council (CURC),

Council (NRDC), the Environmental Defense

Formation (ACCF), Citizens for Responsible

(ACS), the Optical Society of America (OSA),
IEEE-USA, the Task Force on American Inno-
vation (TFAI), the Energy Sciences Coalition
(ESC), and the Gas Technology Institute
(GTI).
Given this broad and deep support from the
leading industrial, academic, scientific, and en-
vironmental organizations of our nation, I look
forward to advancing this bill through the
Committee in the coming months. And I will
continue to work with my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle to build support for this crit-
ical investment in our nation’s clean energy fu-
ture.

IN RECOGNITION OF PENNYTOWN’S
148TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, it brings
me great joy to rise today to commemorate
the 148th anniversary of Pennytown, Missouri.
Founded by former slaves, this historic town
stands as a declaration of what people can
accomplish in the face of adversity. Today,
their descendants gather to honor the memory
of a remarkable chapter of Missouri’s history.
Joseph Penny, the founder and visionary of
Pennytown, was a former slave from Ken-
tucky. Mr. Penny, like many, joined the Great
Migration north, hoping for a better and more
prosperous life. Penny started as a tenant
farmer in the late 1860s, but his life changed
in March of 1871 when he paid $160 for eight
acres of land in Saline County, Missouri. The
purchase of this land marked the birth of
Pennytown. During a time when black Ameri-
cans were not allowed to own land in many
parts of the country, Pennytown became a
haven. By 1879, eleven land acquisitions had
been made. This town became a testament to
the residents’ commitment to maintaining au-
tonomy while helping former slaves in recon-
struction. At its peak, approximately 1,000
freed slaves and their descendants lived in
Pennytown, forming the largest concentration
of black-owned land in Saline County.
At first sight, Pennytown did not appear to
be much. The town only consisted of two
churches, a school and a store. However, this
small collection of farms and buildings made
up a mighty microeconomy. Pennytown was a
vibrant community, strongly intertwined and
loyal. The men would venture from house to
house during the holidays to chop wood for
every family, and the women gathered weekly
to create goods that could be sold, using the
proceeds to create a communal emergency
fund. The descendants of Pennytown help the
legacy of the community live on for younger
generations through stories of the origins and
efforts it took to create such a town.
Today, the Pennytown Freewill Baptist
Church provides a tangible reminder of rural
life for African Americans in the late nine-
teenth and early twentieth centuries, while pre-
serving the integrity of location, design, and
feeling. Much like today, churches in the past
served as much more than just places of wor-
ship, and the Pennytown church was no dif-
ferent. With its Baptist gatherings, social
events, and communal celebrations, the
church was a testament to the perseverance
of a community who had, just six years earlier,
witnessed the abolition of slavery. This com-
munity lasted a few decades, but the unpre-
dictability of time has removed most visible re-
minders of its existence. The Pennytown
Freewill Baptist Church is the last reminder of
what this town once was. The Pennytown de-
scendants who own the church gather to-
gether the first Sunday of every August to cel-
ebrate and honor their rich history and to re-
mind all of us that the past is truly present in
our world today.
Madam Speaker, please join me and the
entirety of Missouri’s Fifth Congressional Dis-
trict in honoring the history of Freewill Baptist
Church and Pennytown as they celebrate an
anniversary of one hundred and forty-eight
years since the founding. I welcome my col-
leagues and fellow citizens across the country
to join me and the constituents of Missouri’s
Fifth Congressional District in reflecting upon
the impactful history held within this one small
church.

RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON
HUAWEI BY THE U.S. GOVERN-

HON. BILL FLORES
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise to
bring additional attention to the national secu-
rity threat that Chinese state-sponsored enti-
ties like Huawei pose to our telecommuni-
cation networks and national security.
This past week, I wrote to Secretary Ross at
the Department of Commerce to consider
Huawei’s track record of espionage and intel-
lectual property theft when enforcing restric-
tions on their trade with U.S. companies.
With the backing of the Chinese govern-
ment, Huawei has attempted to weaponize
patent claims in U.S. courts and to create
vulnerabilities in our communications net-
works.
Restrictions placed on Huawei by the U.S.
federal government were done to address
their pattern of illicit behavior.
We need to continue to stop this Chinese
state-sponsored entity from having access to
our networks when they have so brazenly ex-
ploited U.S. companies and intellectual prop-
erty for Chinese espionage and ill-gotten
gains.

over 2000 hours of police in-service and public
safety officer training, consisting of a variety of
advanced and master-level police courses.
These courses include areas of patrol, ad-
vanced ‘‘auto theft’’ investigation, accident in-
vestigation, defensive tactics training, complex
crimes investigation, Reid Interviewing Ad-
vanced Investigation Techniques, and police
‘‘intoxilyzer operator’’ training. Jon’s dedication
to his fellow officers is apparent in his commit-
ment to the instruction and development of
younger police officers, and Jon has always
been appreciated as an informal leader within
the department.
Jon’s contributions to the law enforcement
operations in the City of Euless has helped to
ensure countless officers were adequately
trained and prepared for the challenges they
face in their everyday duties as police. His
legacy will leave a lasting mark on the City of
Euless and the Euless Police Department for
many years to come.
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to recog-
nize the extensive efforts Jon has contributed
to the City of Euless, and the State of Texas.
I ask all of my distinguished colleagues to join
me in recognizing Senior Officer Jon Pettit for
his many years of service.

IN HONOR OF PASTOR R. L.
ROGERS’ LIFE AND LEGACY
HON. MARC A. VEASEY
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to commemorate the life of Pastor R. L. Rog-
ers—a man of God, a community leader, fa-
ther, and husband.
Pastor Rogers was born on March 6, 1939
in Calvert, Texas to the late Ernest and Mar-
garet Rogers and transitioned from labor to
eternal reward on July 20, 2019, after many
years of giving back to our Dallas-Fort Worth
community.
Pastor Rogers attended high school in south
Texas, before graduating from the South-
western Theological Seminary in Fort Worth,
Texas. Pastor Rogers’ time at seminary start-
ed his journey in faith and helping our commu-
nity that expanded over five decades.
Pastor Rogers was the founder, and the one
and only Pastor for 53 years of the Harvey Av-
enue Baptist Church—a place of worship that
is a cornerstone of the Fort Worth community.
That was only the beginning of his accom-
plishments. Pastor Rogers was also an avid
volunteer for important causes, like mentoring
youth in our community, and serving as a
Chaplain at the Tarrant County Jail. He was
also a nationally known Evangelist, Pastor and
Gospel Preacher.
Pastor Rogers was a pillar of our commu-
nity—spending 53 of his years teaching and
encouraging our community and his accom-
plishments and service will be greatly missed.
HONORING PETER NISSEN
HON. MIKE THOMPSON
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Peter Nis-
sen for his commitment to agriculture and our
wine community and to honor him as the
Napa County Farm Bureau’s 2019
Agriculturalist of the Year.
Mr. Nissen was born in Richmond, Cali-
fornia and began his career in agriculture be-
fore he graduated high school. The summer
before he began his junior year, he moved irri-
gation lines in Cucamonga and Alta Loma
vineyards. Mr. Nissen attended the University
of California at Santa Barbara and graduated
from San Diego State University with a Bach-
elor of Science in Business Administration in
1973. After graduation, Mr. Nissen worked in
the vineyard department of Charles Krug Vin-
ery. Starting in the equipment shop, he
worked in all areas of vineyard operations,
working his way up from the equipment shop
to assistant vineyard manager in 1976. In Feb-
ruary of 1978, Mr. Nissen started Nissen Vine-
yard Services Inc., a vineyard management
business that currently farms over 1100 acres,
most of which are in Napa County. Addition-
ally, his company supplies labor to other agri-
cultural operations.
Mr. Nissen’s involvement in our community
extends beyond his company as he volunteers
his time for numerous agricultural organiza-
tions. He has been a Board Member of Napa
County Farm Bureau (NCFB) since 1998, is a
past President, and is the Board Member rep-
resenting NCFB on the Napa Valley Vine Trail.
Mr. Nissen currently sits on the Board of the
California Farm Labor Contractors Association
and previously served as President. He has
served as coordinator since the NCFB and the
Napa County Agriculture Commissioner’s of-
fice began hosting the annual Ag Day program
for students in second and third grades. Mr.
Nissen volunteered to manage the vineyard at
Carneros Elementary School from 1990 to
2014. He also volunteered to develop and
manage the Napa County Resource Con-
servation District’s Huichica Creek Sustainable
Demonstration Vineyard.
Madam Speaker, Peter Nissen has been a
committed and active member of our agricul-
tural community for many decades. It is there-
fore fitting and proper that we honor him as
the Napa County Farm Bureau’s 2019
Agriculturalist of the Year here today.

HONORING DIANE YODER FOR HER
SELFLESS SERVICE TO OUR HE-
ROES
HON. DANIEL MEUSER
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, it is with
profound respect that I rise today to honor
Diane Yoder of Fleetwood for her incredible
service to our community’s veterans and first
responders.
The Yoder family is a military family; all
three of Diane’s children served, following a
family tradition of service. When her son Jarett
was killed in action in Afghanistan in 2013,
Diane took up this call to service herself. She
began the Jarett Yoder Foundation, a non-
profit with 10 Patriot Houses in Pennsylvania
for veterans and first responders at risk of
homelessness. She is now working with more
than 170 families to provide important re-
sources to them in times of need.
Diane has touched countless lives through
her work and carries on the memory of her
son’s service in her own. I ask my colleagues
to join me in honoring Diane Yoder for her
tireless service for Pennsylvania’s veterans
and first responders.

VOM JOHNATHAN SHEPHERD
HON. KEVIN HERN
OF OKLAHOMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Madam
Speaker, I rise to honor the First District of
Oklahoma’s July Veteran of the Month, Ser-
geant Johnathon Shepherd.
Sergeant Shepherd joined the Marines in
1997, where he served for 5 years, deploying
to the Mediterranean in 2000.
Once back in Tulsa, Sergeant Shepherd
started his first business after learning about
federal opportunities available to veteran-
owned businesses. He and his wife, Jessica,
built the company in their spare time for 8
years before devoting their full efforts to estab-
lish Americom Technologies Group in 2016.
Also in 2016, Sergeant Shepherd and his
wife launched Eagle Ops as an outreach pro-
gram for veterans and their families. In 2018,
they joined with fellow Marine Stacy Hester to
create the Eagle Ops Foundation with the
focus on community. The Foundation is active
in the Tulsa community and works to build re-
lationships for our veterans, their families and
patriots in the community.
Sergeant Shepherd truly is an impressive
man of integrity and honor. He makes Okla-
homa proud and plays an important role in our
community of veterans. I’m glad to have this
opportunity to shine a light on his work and
give him the recognition he deserves as our
July Veteran of the Month.

HON. MATT GAETZ

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, today I rise to
recognize the Center for Independent Living
Disability Resource Center (CILDRC). That is
committed as epitomized in their mission
statement, ‘‘to assist individuals with disabil-
ities achieve their goals of independence’’.
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),
passed July 26, 1990, put into law the ideal
that Americans with disabilities should not be

opportunity, public building access areas, and

other accommodating services. Expanding
upon these, CILDRC assists those with dis-
abilities in asserting their freedoms to become
independent.
The CILDRC assists, both, our communities
and individuals with disabilities by offering
work experience programs to receive the
knowledge required to go into the workforce
and to contribute to businesses and organiza-
tions across Northwest Florida.
This year is the 29th anniversary of the
Americans with Disabilities Act. The CILDRC
luncheon is celebrating the importance of the
ADA and reaffirms that the ADA is vital in pro-
tecting those in our communities with disabil-
ities.
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United
States Congress, I am privileged to congratu-
late the Center for Independent Living Dis-
ability Resource Center (CILDRC) on their ef-
forts to make an impact with and on behalf of
people with disabilities in our communities.

TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE AND LEG-
ACY OF ELIJAH ‘‘PUMPSIE’’
GREEN
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the life and legacy of a
groundbreaking professional baseball player,
Richmond native, and longtime El Cerrito resi-
dent, Elijah ‘‘Pumpsie’’ Green.
Born in 1933 in Oklahoma, Pumpsie’s par-
ents moved to Richmond, California, where
they raised their five children. Pumpsie at-
tended El Cerrito High School where he was
an accomplished three-sport athlete who
would later earn distinction as an inductee into
the school’s inaugural Athletic Hall of Fame
class. He ultimately chose to pursue baseball,
starring at Contra Costa College before joining
the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast
League.
In 1959, 12 years after Jackie Robinson
broke Major League Baseball’s color barrier,
Pumpsie became one of the game’s true trail-
blazers when he became the first African
American player ever to play for the Boston
Red Sox. Despite facing continued discrimina-
tion and segregation, he went on to play five
seasons for the Red Sox before being traded
to the New York Mets and retiring in 1963.
After retiring as a professional baseball
player, Pumpsie moved with his family to El
Cerrito, where he devoted the rest of his life
to education. He served as a student super-
visor and baseball coach at Berkeley High
School, and during his 20-year tenure became
a mentor to countless students.
Pumpsie will forever be remembered for his
role in helping to end segregation in profes-
sional sports and paving the way for other ath-
letes of color. Please join me in honoring Eli-
jah ‘‘Pumpsie’’ Green for his lasting impact on
professional baseball and his dedication to
youth. He is truly an inspiration for his Bay
Area home.
HONORING DIANE VANDERKOOY
FOR BEING SELECTED TO BE
PART OF THE LAW ENFORCE-
MENT TORCH RUN AT THE SPE-
CIAL OLYMPICS WORLD GAMES
HON. DARIN LaHOOD
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor Diane VanderKooy, of Chatham, Illinois,
for participating in the Law Enforcement Torch
Run at the Special Olympics World Games in
Abu Dhabi.
Diane began her involvement with the Spe-
cial Olympics in 1990. Since then, Diane has
put her heart and soul into the games.
VanderKooy plays a major role in coordinating
the Gillespie to Bloomington leg of the Law
Enforcement Torch Run in Illinois. This was
Diane’s first time at the World Games, as she
joined a team of 112 members who took part
in the torch run throughout the United Arab
Emirates.
Diane has dedicated her life to ensuring that
people have a fun and safe environment to
participate in whichever sport they desire. Not
only is VanderKooy deeply involved with the
Special Olympics, but she is also the Athletic
Director for the Chatham Chargers. Diane was
recently recognized by the Village of Chatham
for her service to the village and community
with an honorary designation of a local road-
way as ‘‘Diane VanderKooy Volunteer Drive.’’
Diane’s work proves that athletics can have a
positive and meaningful impact on people from
all walks of life.
Again, I would like to commend Diane
VanderKooy for her continued service in the
community, and for participating in the Law
Enforcement Torch Run at the Special Olym-
pics World Games.

HONORING MOUNTAINMAN OUT-
DOOR SUPPLY COMPANY OWNER
JOHN NEMJO FOR WINNING THE
NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS AS-
SOCIATION’S SMALL BUSINESS
EXCELLENCE AWARD
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the achievements of one of
the North Country’s most successful small
business owners, John Nemjo.
John demonstrated his entrepreneurial spirit
when he opened Mountainman Outdoor Sup-
ply Company in 1993. Back then, he ran the
company out of an abandoned, 700 square
foot pizza shop in the heart of the Adirondack
State Park with just a couple seasonal em-
ployees and a budget of a few thousand dol-
lars.
In the decades since, John has grown his
company into a fixture of the Adirondack busi-
ness community. He now operates a thriving
business out of six locations with over 15,000
square feet in combined retail space. Instead
of a handful of seasonal employees, John now
has 53 year-round employees. Adirondack
Bank acknowledged John’s achievements with
a 2018 Small Business Excellence Award.
Small business owners like John Nemjo
benefit our communities in so many ways.
They employ local residents and contribute to
the dynamism and vibrancy of our economy.
On behalf of New York’s 21st Congressional
District, I want to congratulate him for this
well-deserved recognition and thank him for
his contribution to our community.

INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO RE-
MOVE THE STATUE OF CONFED-
ERATE GENERAL ALBERT PIKE
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to in-
troduce a bill to require the removal of a stat-
ue of Confederate General Albert Pike from
federal land near Judiciary Square in the Dis-
trict of Columbia. This statue was authorized,
not by the District, but by Congress in 1898,
when the District had no home rule. The stat-
ue was constructed using both federal and pri-
vate funds. The Freemasons, of which Pike
was a member, donated the majority of the
money needed to build and install the statue
in 1901. I oppose tearing down Confederate
statues, because I believe they should be
moved to more appropriate settings, like mu-
seums, to avoid erasing an important part of
history from which Americans must continue to
learn.
Pike was a Confederate general who served
dishonorably and was forced to resign in dis-
grace. It was found that soldiers under his
command mutilated the bodies of Union sol-
diers, and Pike was ultimately imprisoned after
his fellow officers reported that he misappro-
priated funds. Adding to the dishonor of taking
up arms against the United States, Pike dis-
honored even his Confederate military service.
He certainly has no claim to be memorialized
in the nation’s capital. Even those who do not
want Confederate statues removed will have
to justify awarding Pike any honor, considering
his history.
After meeting with the Freemasons, I be-
lieve that the best course of action is to re-
move the statue and find a more appropriate
place for it. The Freemasons themselves sup-
port the statue’s removal, given its divisive na-
ture. The D.C. Mayor and the Council also
support the removal of the statue.
My bill clarifies that no federal funds may be
used to remove the Pike statue. I urge my col-
leagues to support this important legislation.

Science in Business Administration and a
minor in Economics. Mr. Pedroza began his
career working in the financial services indus-
try. He worked with credit unions and commu-
nity banks for over a decade, where he gained
valuable financial expertise he has used to
help our local business community improve,
manage, and sustain their financial growth. In
2012, Mr. Pedroza was elected to the Napa
City Council. He became both the first Latino
member and the youngest city councilmember
ever elected to the Napa City Council. Gov-
ernor Jerry Brown appointed Mr. Pedroza to
serve the Fourth District on the Napa County
Board of Supervisors in December of 2014.
Mr. Pedroza went on to win a full, four-year
term on the Board of Supervisors in the 2016
primary election.
Mr. Pedroza’s deep ties to Napa County
and commitment to public service drive him to
serve our community, including the agricultural
sector. He is dedicated to enacting sound agri-
cultural policy. He has worked tirelessly on ag-
ricultural issues that have come before the
Board of Supervisors. His passion for serving
the community extends beyond his career, as
Mr. Pedroza is active in a local service clubs
and nonprofits. Through his work on the Board
of Supervisors and with nonprofit organiza-
tions, Mr. Pedroza hopes to realize a Napa
County that will allow future generations of
Napa residents to start businesses, raise fami-
lies, and live fulfilling lives.
Madam Speaker, Alfredo Pedroza has an
unrelenting dedication to our agricultural com-
munity and to serving the people of Napa
County and is deserving of being named Napa
County Farm Bureau’s 2019 Friend of Agri-
culture. It is therefore fitting and proper that
we honor the service of Alfredo Pedroza here
today.

REMEMBERING JOE H. BARRAGAN
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 30, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the life of Joe H. Barragan, an es-
teemed Californian and an outstanding gen-
tleman to everyone who knew him. Mr.
Barragan passed away on November 19, 2018
but will continue to be remembered for his
love of family, commitment to serving his com-
munity, and passion for working to make the
world a better place.
Mr. Barragan was born on December 31,
1931 and attended Saint Ferdinand School
and San Fernando High School. A man of ex-
traordinary character and patriotism, he nobly
served our nation as a member of the United
States Army during the Korean War.
Though his sacrifices for our country alone
are enough to warrant the highest respect and
praise, we could not properly celebrate a man
such as him without mentioning the generous
life he led in his community. In the years after
he returned from war, Mr. Barragan spent his
time enriching the lives of others without ever
expecting anything in return. He will be re-
membered for his endless kindness and love
of all people.
Mr. Barragan is survived by his wife of 61
years, Virginia Barragan; his two daughters,
Susan Arriaga and Belinda Barragan; his son-
in-law, Danny Arriaga; his two grandchildren,
Daniel Arriaga Jr. and Jessica Arriaga; and his
dog, Demi.
As his family and community continue to
hold the legacy and memory of Mr. Joe H.
Barragan in their hearts, I ask my colleagues
to join me in recognizing this outstanding man
and the virtues he held so dear to him. May
his memory serve as an example for all seek-
ing to lead a happy and joyful life and may his
spirit rest in peace and glory.
