PRAYER
Reverend Dr. Dan C. Cummins, Cap-
itol Worship, Washington, D.C., offered
the following prayer:
Father of all mercy and grace, enable
us by Your holy spirit to fulfill Your
joy in us.
When opposing opinions prevail, let
us pray, ‘‘Not my will, but Thy will be
done,’’ being assured that nothing is
hidden from Your eyes.
And when we are divided over policy,
let us be broken in spirit before You
and each other, seeking the wisdom of
God when agreeable solutions elude us.
Let nothing be done through strife or
vanity, choosing, rather, to put on the
mind of our savior, who made of him-
self no reputation but took on the form
of a servant, accepting our sins as his
own, becoming obedient unto the death
of the cross.
And when unfounded accusations are
made against us, let us pray, ‘‘Father,
forgive them,’’ considering Your own
condemnation by sinful men.
And restore to us, we pray, the joy of
our salvation.
In Jesus’ name we pray.
Amen.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1499
November 22, 2019
IN RECOGNITION OF THE LONG-
TIME SERVICE OF MAYOR RICH-
ARD ZIEGLER
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 22, 2019
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Mayor Richard Ziegler.
Mayor Ziegler has served the City of Wixom
for more than twenty-two years. Those dec-
ades of service include two years as Mayor,
almost twenty years as a member of the
Wixom City Council, and eight years as a
Wixom police officer.
Mayor Ziegler’s career is a quintessential
model of civic engagement and leadership. In
his many years of service, he has been inti-
mately involved in the decision-making proc-
esses of his city; addressing public concerns
and safeguarding the values of the commu-
nity. He and his wife, Melody—who herself
served the Wixom Police Department for twen-
ty-four years—have chosen to devote their ca-
reers to promoting the quality of their commu-
nity. We, in Michigan’s 11th Congressional
District, are so very grateful for their work.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in reflecting on the remarkable career of
Mayor Ziegler and his many contributions to
his community in Wixom, Michigan.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 75TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE JEWISH
COMMUNITY RELATIONS BUREAU
OF THE AMERICAN JEWISH COM-
MITTEE
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 22, 2019
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I proudly
rise today to recognize the seventy-fifth anni-
versary of the Jewish Community Relations
Bureau of the American Jewish Committee
(JCRB/AJC).
The American Jewish Committee was
founded in 1906 in the wake of the Kishinev
programs by Cyrus Adler, Jacob Schiff, Mayer
Sulzberger, Louis Marshall, and other promi-
nent leaders of the American Jewish commu-
nity to advocate for the security of Jews every-
where. AJC eventually became known across
the globe for its advocacy, support, and
unremitting commitment to the preservation of
Jewish communities nationally and abroad.
From campaigning against the literacy test for
immigrants, calling for more inclusive U.S. im-
migration policies in the early 1900s, joining
emergency relief efforts to assist more than
10,000 European Jews en route to the U.S. in
the 1920s, joining NBC in broadcasting the
first Jewish religious service from Germany
since the rise of Nazism in 1944, and playing
a vital role in negotiating the $822 million Hol-
ocaust restitution settlement with Germany on
behalf of Jewish people in 1952, AJC has
worked to not only better the lives of Jews
across the world, but society as a whole.
JCRB/AJC Kansas City was established in
1944 as a result of merging what was Kansas
City’s AJC regional office and the local Jewish
Community Relations Bureau. Now one seam-
less organization, JCRB/AJC’s mission com-
bines AJC’s global reach with the local
JCRB’s tradition of community relations activi-
ties. Serving Kansas and western Missouri,
JCRB/AJC advocates and educates to elimi-
nate injustice and discrimination through its
community and globally led initiatives, as well
as connecting Kansas City with the broader
network of AJC’s partners. JCRB/AJC’s mis-
sion reflects the American Jewish Committee’s
pledge to enhance the wellbeing of the Jewish
people and Israel by combatting antisemitism,
promoting Israel’s place in the world, and
countering the spread of radicalism and extre-
mism. The impact of their work has resulted in
a plethora of concrete results in the form of
government policies, alliances, and legislation
that make our world safer and more secure. In
line with their historic and deep commitment to
interorganization and interreligious coopera-
tion, JCRB/AJC works closely with other
faiths, educators, elected officials, and minority
communities to pursue justice for all.
For seventy-five years, JCRB/AJC has been
a pillar of leadership throughout the Kansas
City area, leading the way in empowering
marginalized communities through unmatched
advocacy and community unification.
Madam Speaker, please join me and Mis-
souri’s Fifth Congressional District in honoring
JCRB/AJC Kansas City’s seventy-fifth anniver-
sary and their dedication to advancing justice
for Jewish and minority communities through-
out the world.

HONORING DRS. SALLY AND BEN-
NETT SHAYWITZ 2019 RECIPIENTS
OF THE LIBERTY SCIENCE CEN-
TER GENIUS AWARD
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 22, 2019
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, at this
year’s Liberty Science Center Genius Gala,
two outstanding members of my District, and
my very good friends, Drs. Sally and Bennett
Shaywitz were recognized with a 2019 Genius
Award in recognition of their invaluable con-
tributions to the study of dyslexia and its im-
pact on those afflicted with this frustrating
learning disorder. Two of five visionary men
and women of science bestowed this pres-
tigious honor this year, this is a remarkable
tribute to the lifetime of good work that Sally
and Bennett have done.
The world’s leading experts on dyslexia,
Sally and Bennett are the Co-Founders and
Co-Directors of the Yale Center for Dyslexia
and Creativity. Academic physicians, Sally
specializing in developmental pediatrics and
Bennett a neurologist and neuroscientist, they
worked together to discover dyslexia’s sci-
entific basis, pioneer effective therapies, and
change public attitudes. Afflicting one in five
people in the United States, dyslexia is our
most common learning disorder and it has
been through the leadership of Sally and Ben-
nett that we better understand this disorder—
why it happens and how it can change over
time.
Lab partners for thirty-five years—a partner-
ship that is only outmatched by their marriage
of fifty-five years—Sally and Bennett made it
their life’s work to understand how reading be-
havior might change from childhood to adult-
hood. Over the course of the last three and a
half decades, they have continuously studied
four hundred fifty-five people from the age of
five. Their research has definitively dem-
onstrated that dyslexia affects boys and girls
in equal numbers, is not something that is out-
grown, and is not linked to intelligence. Brain
scan studies that Bennett conducted reveal a
neural signature, a particular brain abnor-
mality, is responsible for dyslexia. The results
of their dedicated efforts have debunked the
myth that those with dyslexia are simply less
intelligent and has enabled physicians, sci-
entists, teachers, and policy makers to better
understand how to best help those affected by
the disorder.
The Library Science Center is dedicated to
inspiring the next generation of scientists and
engineers and to exciting learners of all ages
about the power, promise, and pure fun of
science and technology. Each year their Ge-
nius Awards Gala honors pioneers in science,
technology, and innovation. It is a fitting rec-
ognition of the lifetime achievement of this
special couple. It is with great pride that I
stand today to join the New Haven community
in extending my heartfelt congratulations to
Sally and Bennett Shaywitz on this very spe-
cial honor.

REMEMBERING THE HONORABLE
HENRY ‘‘HANK’’ WEDAA
HON. GILBERT RAY CISNEROS, JR.
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 22, 2019
Mr. CISNEROS. Madam Speaker, it is with
immense sadness and a heavy heart that I
rise to mark the passing of the Honorable
Henry ‘‘Hank’’ Wedaa, former mayor and long-
time council member of Yorba Linda. On the
morning of November 13, 2019, Henry passed
away in his Anaheim home at the age of 95.
As a member of the Greatest Generation and
a Yorba Linda ‘‘founding father’’ who dedi-
cated his life to public service, Henry was a
shining example of courage, determination,
and selflessness. He will be missed dearly by
family, friends, and the community he devoted
his life to.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1500 November 22, 2019
Though an established Yorba Linda resident
for over 50 years, Henry’s roots began in At-
lantic City, New Jersey. He was born on Feb-
ruary 15, 1924 as the eldest child of five to
Henrik and Anna Wedaa. As a young child,
Henry discovered a love for aviation and spent
time watching planes make emergency land-
ings on a golf course near his home. Though
uncertain of the future, he was resolute in his
belief that he would one day take to the skies.
Henry’s prediction proved to be correct with
the news of Pearl Harbor and the subsequent
declaration of war. Like many of his time,
Henry became part of the nationwide move-
ment of young individuals who lent their youth
and passion to protect the freedom of their be-
loved country. On January 5, 1943, at the age
of 18, Henry joined the infantry but was soon
transferred to what he knew to be his true call-
ing—the United States Air Force. Assigned to
the 467th Bombardment Group as a bom-
bardier and aerial gunner, Henry and his fel-
low men left for Rackheath, United Kingdom
on his 20th birthday. Beginning April 10, 1944,
the 467th Bombardment Group would com-
plete its required 30 missions in just 78 days.
Henry solemnly watched events of the Euro-
pean Theater unfold as he sat on the nose of
a B–24 Liberator 20,000 feet up in the air. Re-
turning to the United States after his last mis-
sion, Henry was promoted to 1st Lieutenant
and was awarded the Distinguished Flying
Cross and Air Medal with three oak leaf clus-
ters.
After his service in WWII, Henry graduated
from Gettysburg College in Gettysburg, Penn-
sylvania in 1949, majoring in physics and
chemistry. He then attended graduate school
at the University of Arizona and was employed
at the U.S. Naval Weapons Center in China
Lake, California for eight years. It was during
this time that Henry was met with the fortu-
itous opportunity to settle down in Yorba
Linda, California. In 1970, three years after the
incorporation of Yorba Linda, he began his
second act of public service as a city
councilmember. Henry would serve Yorba
Linda for 29 years. During this extensive ten-
ure, in which he served as mayor five times,
Henry championed for a particular quality of
life in Yorba Linda. The Yorba Linda in exist-
ence today that favors a semi-rural, low-den-
sity community owes its idyllic charm and me-
thodical process of change to Henry’s original
vision. During his time on the city council,
many iconic city projects were approved: the
Richard Nixon Presidential Library, the SAVI
Ranch Retail Center, the Yorba Linda Com-
munity Center, and over a dozen city parks.
Henry represented the city council on numer-
ous committees including the Southern Cali-
fornia Association of Governments’ Aviation
Work Program Committee. Henry also acted
as chairman of the governing board of South
Coast Air Quality Management District and
president of the Southern California Associa-
tion of Governments.
Though public service was always at the
forefront of his life, Henry also led a distin-
guished professional career that aligned with
his passion for pure, unadulterated quality of
life. Working in parallel as he helped shape
Yorba Linda, Henry dedicated himself to spe-
cializing in transportation and environmental
studies. As a founder of the California Hydro-
gen Business Council, Henry made a name
for himself as a renowned advocate for clean
air, alternative energy, and reducing emis-
sions. He urged for the development of hydro-
gen fuel cells in the 39th District and was
awarded the Haagen-Smit Clean Air Award
from California Air Resources Board for his
commitment to accelerating the future of hy-
drogen vehicles and green sources of energy.
Henry is survived by his sons Eric and Jim,
and daughters Karena and Tina. He also
leaves behind an insurmountable legacy rein-
forced by the people whose lives were
touched by his leadership and care. Madam
Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my
distinguished colleagues join me in remem-
bering Henry ‘‘Hank’’ Wedaa: an American pa-
triot, a devout environmentalist, and a vision-
ary father to the city of Yorba Linda.

TRIBUTE TO JOEY SANTOS
HON. MICHAEL F. Q. SAN NICOLAS
OF GUAM
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 22, 2019
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in solemn remembrance of a good man
from Guam—Joey Santos, whose passing
came too soon on November 17, 2019, at the
age of 49.
Joey was a shining star going as far back
as the 1980s. He was a mentor to many and
a friend to many more.
He attended the John F. Kennedy High
School and played for the JFK Islanders bas-
ketball team. He proved what a valuable force
he was even in his teens while playing high
school basketball. Not long after graduation
from JFK in 1988, he represented our island
through his love of the game and decided to
make an impact playing for the Guam National
Basketball team. His dedication to the game
showed through his determination and com-
mitment with his countless hours on the court.
In 1991, he took on a role with the Univer-
sity of Guam and worked his way up the ranks
to the position of Recreational Supervisor up
until his resignation in 2010. After 19 years of
service to the University, he decided to em-
bark on a new path. He accepted a position
with the Father Duenas Memorial School as a
physical education teacher, and eventually
promoted to Athletic Director. Joey also
served for 20 years in the Air National Guard
and retired in October 2017 as a staff ser-
geant.
Joey was a visionary for athletes. He want-
ed to help others maximize their potential and
reach their goals. For a decade, he mentored
high school athletes and truly led by example
by demonstrating what it means to work
hard—and not only on the field or on the court
but in the classroom as well. He wanted our
kids to succeed. He wanted to show them that
anything was possible. He was much more
than an Athletic Director, he was a hero to the
students and he went out of his way to help
others. Anyone who knew him was lucky to
have a glimpse of who he was.
Joey is a man of strength and courage. He
fought cancer so hard for his wife, family, stu-
dents, and those who were counting on him.
Joey had a heart of gold—and he not only
portrayed that on the basketball court or
through his duties on the job, but in his daily
life.
Joey’s wife, Selena Santos, said it best: ‘‘My
Chamoru Rock left with his eternal wings to
our Almighty Father.’’
Joey is survived by his wife, Selena, his
children David, Tayler, and Shylah, and his
five grandchildren: Tobias, Taeya, and Rocky.
He is also survived by his mother Maria, and
his siblings Jeanie, Joyce, and Jeffrey, and
beloved friends.
I would like to convey my deepest sym-
pathies to Joey’s family, as well as extend my
heartfelt thanks for his contributions to the
community. Joey Santos will be missed by all
who knew him.

HONORING ALEXANDER C.
MARTIN, ESQ.
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 22, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable
public servant, Mr. Alexander C. Martin, Esq.
A native of Port Gibson, Mississippi, Mr. Mar-
tin earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Polit-
ical Science from Alcorn State University, in
1979, and a Juris Doctorate degree from the
University of Mississippi School of Law in
1982.
Since its establishment, in 1994, Mr. Martin
has served as the District Attorney for the
State of Mississippi’s 22nd Circuit Court Dis-
trict. He is the first African American to serve
as District Attorney for the state of Mississippi,
since Reconstruction. Prior to his position as
District Attorney, Mr. Martin served as an at-
torney for Southwest and Central Mississippi
Legal Services. In addition, he spent six years
as a prosecutor for Claiborne County as well
as an adjunct professor at his alma mater,
Alcorn State University.
In 2006, Mr. Martin received the Legal
Award from the Claiborne County Chapter of
the NAACP.
Aside from his career, Mr. Martin has been
heavily involved in his community. He cur-
rently serves as a deacon at First Baptist
Church in Port Gibson. For seven years, he
was an assistant scout master for Troop 100
of Boy Scouts of America, Andrew Jackson
Council. Since 2005, Mr. Martin has been the
public address announcer for football and bas-

SUNRISE CENTER CELEBRATES
CHILDREN’S GRIEF AWARENESS
DAY
HON. PAUL COOK
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 22, 2019
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, Children’s
Grief Awareness Day was created in 2009 to
foster awareness and understanding about the
impact of death on children. As we approach
the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, we
enter a particularly difficult time for grieving
children. One in five children will experience
the death of someone close to them by age
18, one in twenty children will experience the
death of a parent by age 18, and approxi-
mately 1.9 million children under 18 have lost
one or both of their parents.
The Sunrise Center helps children dealing
with grief, by offering a place of hope and
healing for children, teens, and their families
who are experiencing grief and loss due to the
advanced illness or death of a loved one or
being placed in foster care. Their hard work
supports children suffering from grief in a safe,
loving, and understanding environment.
Children’s Grief Awareness Day is an impor-
tant way for all of us to remember those in our
society who are dealing with the emotional
trauma relating to the death or loss of a loved
one. I applaud the Sunrise Center for all they
do to support local children dealing with these
tragic circumstances, and I sincerely thank
their volunteers and staff for making a dif-
ference in children’s lives.

COMMEMORATION OF THE 44TH
ANNIVERSARY OF THE KOREAN
WOMEN’S ASSOCIATION OF GUAM
HON. MICHAEL F.Q. SAN NICOLAS
OF GUAM
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 22, 2019
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to commemorate the Korean Women’s
Association of Guam (KWAG) on their 44th
Anniversary. I extend my sincerest congratula-
tions to KWAG for another outstanding event
celebrating efforts to strengthen various com-
munity foundations in its spirit of charity.
The Korean Women’s Association of Guam
was established on June 25, 1975 and has
since made it their mission to encourage be-
nevolence and unity, enriching togetherness
and friendship among Korean women, and in-
spiring the Korean culture to remain lively
throughout the island of Guam. The associa-
tion received recognition both locally and inter-
nationally for their efforts in assisting the less
fortunate, abused, ill, and elderly in our com-
munity.
The Korean Women’s Association of Guam
has persevered in giving back to our island
through their fundraising endeavors; assisting
in relief efforts and collaborating with other or-
ganizations for a significant cause. Their de-
sire to help local organizations serve our com-
munity over the years is truly something to
celebrate and support.
I thank the Korean Women’s Association of
Guam President Sunok E. Chi, for her leader-
ship, and its members for continuously exert-
ing their mission and exemplifying the vision,
values, and traditions of the organization.
Again, congratulations to another flourishing
year and I look forward to the Korean Wom-
en’s Association of Guam’s continued con-
tributions to the community and future suc-
cess.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE ONE
HUNDRED FIFTIETH ANNIVER-
SARY OF JOHN DEERE
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 22, 2019
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the 150th anniversary of John
Deere in Kansas City, Missouri.
In 1869, Charles Deere, Vice President and
son of John Deere, established a regional of-
fice for the company, known as the Kansas
City Branch House in the West Bottoms of
Kansas City, Missouri. Its proximity to roads,
rivers and rail systems would eventually help
John Deere grow and keep pace with a rapidly
growing country.
Since its founding, John Deere has helped
lead the way for community and economic
growth as one of the first businesses and em-
ployers in Kansas City. In 2019, the company
continues to thrive and remains a positive eco-
nomic influence at the local, state and national
level. John Deere’s presence in Kansas City is
a valuable reminder of the important role agri-
culture has played in our country and con-
tinues to play as American farmers work to
feed the world’s growing population.
During its 150-year presence, John Deere
has employed thousands at their local dealer-
ships and regional offices. Today, the com-
pany is a global leader in the manufacturing,
distribution and sales of agricultural, turf, con-
struction and forestry equipment.
Agricultural output must double in order to
feed a global population that is estimated to
reach 9.8 billion people by the year 2050.
John Deere, in collaboration with American
farmers, is committed to helping feed the
world’s population, and, consequently, they
are providing the latest equipment technology
and data required to meet the ever-increasing
food, fiber, and fuel needs.
John Deere continues to be a strong advo-
cate and champion for agriculture while re-
maining committed core values of integrity,
quality, commitment and innovation. The com-
pany has a higher purpose of serving those
who are linked to the land, guiding the com-
pany and its leaders as they continue a jour-
ney its founder began back in 1837—a jour-
ney that I believe leads to a future filled with
great promise and opportunity for the com-
pany and the broader agriculture sector.
Madam Speaker, please join me and Mis-
souri’s Fifth Congressional District in honoring
the 150th anniversary of John Deere in Kan-
sas City, Missouri.

TRIBUTE TO READ TO GROW
FOUNDER, ROXANNE J. COADY
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 22, 2019
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it gives
me great pleasure to rise today to join the
many family, friends, and colleagues who
have gathered to celebrate the 20th Anniver-
sary of Read to Grow, a non-profit organiza-
tion in Connecticut whose mission is to im-
prove early literacy, and to pay tribute to the
organization’s founder, Roxanne J. Coady,
who recently stepped down as founding board
chair. Roxanne’s extraordinary vision has im-
pacted thousands of families and children
across Connecticut.
Roxanne’s passion for books and reading
led to her second career. She left her role as
the first female National Tax Director at BDO
Seidman, for Madison, Connecticut where she
restored a downtown building, establishing RJ
Julia Booksellers and she, along with an in-
credible group of booksellers, transformed her
charming local store into a nationally recog-
nized authority on books. She also recently
opened a second location, Wesleyan RJ Julia
Bookstore, in Middletown, Connecticut which
not only returned a bookstore downtown, but
also serves as the official bookstore for Wes-
leyan University.
In fact, RJ Julia’s is well-known for hosting
book signing events, not only with local au-
thors but with recognized celebrities such as
lifestyle and fashion icon Lauren Conrad,
Today show co-anchor and Dateline NBC cor-
respondent, Hoda Kotb, former first daughters
and bestselling authors Jenna Bush Hager
and Barbara Pierce Bush, and just recently

former Secretary of the State Hillary Clinton
and her daughter Chelsea Clinton. Her dedica-
tion and passion have earned her a distin-
guished reputation and she has built a remark-
able success.
Roxanne wanted to do more—she wanted
to ensure that every child was exposed to the
wonders and magic of the written word and
that every parent was empowered as their ba-
bies’ first teachers. She knew that not every
child and parent had that opportunity. And so,
with a small group of like-minded women, she
founded Read To Grow. Read To Grow’s mis-
sion is to build literacy from birth and over the
last twenty years they have done just that.
Under Roxanne’s leadership, they have ex-
panded their programs to include the Books
for Babies Program, the Books for Kids Pro-
gram, and the Early Steps to School Success
Program; they have had more than two million
books donated, provided more than three hun-
dred thousand newborn literacy packets, and
opened thirty-four book places, where parents
can select free books for their kids. Through
this variety of programs and services, Read
To Grow has impacted more than one million
adults, children, and babies. It has been a
special experience to work with Read To Grow
and Roxanne during my tenure in Congress.
I would be remiss if I did not extend a spe-
cial note of thanks to Roxanne for the kind-
ness and generosity she has extended to my-
self and my husband over the years, hosting
book signings for each of us and providing
support as well as guidance on issues of lit-
eracy to myself and my staff. I consider myself
fortunate to call her my friend.
As Read To Grow marks its 20th Anniver-
sary and Roxanne steps down as the founding
board chair, she can be proud of the strong
foundation on which this wonderful organiza-
tion has been built. I have no doubt that it will
long stand as one of her greatest legacies.
Today, it is my honor to stand and extend my
deepest thanks, appreciation and heartfelt
congratulations to Roxanne J. Coady for her
exceptional contributions to our community.
Her good work has left an indelible mark on
the lives of many.

TRIBUTE TO NEAL S. DUDOVITZ
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 22, 2019
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Neal Dudovitz, who recently retired
from his position as Executive Director of
Neighborhood Legal Services of Los Angeles
County (NLSLA). A visionary leader and advo-
cate in providing access to legal representa-
tion and justice to the underprivileged for over
four decades, Mr. Dudovitz has served the
Los Angeles area for the last twenty-five years
at NLSLA.
During his time at NLSLA, Neal was instru-
mental in helping the organization reach its full
potential to become one of the most prominent
public interest legal services firms in the State
of California. When he joined NLSLA in 1993,
there was a staff of thirty members, one office
and the budget was three million dollars;
today, NLSLA has one hundred-fifty staff
members, four offices, and a budget nearing
twenty million dollars.
Under Mr. Dudovitz’ leadership, NLSLA de-
veloped an efficient model of service delivery
that combined impact litigation, policy advo-
cacy and direct representation to support op-
portunities for families to move themselves out
of poverty, reduce the effects of poverty, and
to enforce and protect the legal rights of the
underprivileged by ensuring access to the jus-
tice system. The organization now has one of
the largest networks of self-help legal access
centers in the country. In addition, NLSLA di-
rected an innovative project of Medical Legal
Community Partnerships which places NLSLA
attorneys in community hospital and clinics,
led a collaborative of programs in Los Angeles
that provides legal representation to those fac-
ing eviction in impoverished neighborhoods,
and initiated the Health Consumer Center,
which has helped thousands of people access
critical care, and which led to successful law-
suits that altered how Los Angeles County ad-
ministered its Medi-Cal program. Additionally,
Mr. Dudovitz has been a tireless and effective
advocate for legal services for the under-
served and underprivileged, and has been a
partner to me in my efforts to support the
Legal Services Corporation.
The awards that Mr. Dudovitz has received
and the organizations he has been active in
throughout his career is indicative of his prom-
inence as a leader, mentor and agent of
change. He received the Section Achievement
Award from the State Bar of California Legal
Services and was named one of the San Fer-
nando Valley Business Journals’ Top 25 law-
yers. In addition, Neal served as a delegate to
The White House Conference on Aging and
was an active member of the Lawyer’s Advi-
sory for the Legal Aid Association of Cali-
fornia.
I ask all members to join me in honoring
Neal Dudovitz for his outstanding contributions
to the Los Angeles community and offering
our best wishes upon his retirement.

TRIBUTE FOR SUSAN MISKIN
HON. MAX ROSE
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 22, 2019
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor Susan Miskin on the occa-
sion of her upcoming retirement from a career
of dedicated service to her fellow Staten Is-
landers, particularly those with special needs.
Throughout her 26 years as a speech thera-
pist in New York City’s school system, Susan
has impacted the lives of countless students,
and most recently, families of children with
special needs.
Susan started her career in Brooklyn, work-
ing with students in grades 6 through 8. Since
2006, she has worked on Staten Island at
Susan E. Wagner High School. There, she
began working with students on the Autism
spectrum. As many of these students stay in
high school for a longer period of time, Susan
got to know her students over the course of
many years and help guide them into adult-
hood.
Susan went above and beyond to help
these students. She has always thought of
new and innovative ways to ensure that her
students’ needs were met. For example, she
created a buddy program at Susan E. Wag-
ner, pairing incoming freshmen who have spe-
cial needs with a senior student at the school.
This program is designed to ensure a smooth
transition to the high school for these students
and has been a great success.
In fact, even in retirement, Susan’s commit-
ment to serving these students is not going
anywhere, as she has promised to continue
working as a volunteer with this buddy pro-
gram. Susan represents the best of Staten Is-
land and South Brooklyn. She is a hard-
working individual who has dedicated her life
to helping others. We all would do well to fol-
low her lead. So, Madam Speaker, I rise today
to ask my colleagues to join me in honoring
the career of Susan Miskin, for all of the hard
work she has done and will continue to do to
help her students, and to wish her the best in
her upcoming retirement.

21ST CENTURY YOUTH
ENTREPRENEURSHIP ACT
HON. GRACE MENG
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 22, 2019
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, this week is
Global Entrepreneurship Week—a time to rec-
ognize the importance of entrepreneurship in
our communities and economy. Entrepreneur-
ship kindles the spark of creativity and inge-
nuity that has been such a cornerstone of our
economy. Fostering more entrepreneurs is
also a poverty alleviation solution. Studies
showed that for every one-percentage point in-
crease in the rate of entrepreneurship in a
state, there is a two-percentage point de-
crease in the poverty rate.
Furthermore, additional studies show that
two-thirds of adults worldwide are financially il-
literate while 57 percent of U.S. adults overall
are financially literate—ranking the U.S. 14th
in the world in financial literacy. Only 17 states
require high school students to take a course
in personal finance, and students without a fi-
nancial education are more likely to have low
credit scores and other financial problems.
Madam Speaker, we already know that en-
trepreneurship requires creative problem-solv-
ing skills, leadership, teamwork, and adapt-
ability, which are skills necessary for the 21st
century workforce. Forty percent of American
middle and high school students say they plan
to start a business, and 29 percent said they
planned to invent something that will change
the world. These rates increase significantly
for students who participate in entrepreneur-
ship programs.
That is why I will be introducing the 21st
Century Youth Entrepreneurship Act—to cre-
ate a pathway to empower our youth to be-
come next generation of leaders and
innovators through the inclusion of entrepre-
neurship programs within our K–12 public
school system, community colleges, libraries,
and other community spaces.
Specifically, the 21st Century Youth Entre-
preneurship Act would:
Amend Title IV of ESEA to allow for local
and state educational agencies to include en-
trepreneurship programs, financial literacy pro-
grams, and leadership programs within exist-
ing curricula, utilizing pre-existing funds; and
Amend the Perkins Career and Technical
Education Act to explicitly include ‘‘entrepre-
neurship education programs’’ as an allowable
use of funds.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1503
November 22, 2019
Bringing entrepreneurship into places such
as schools provide youth a safe space to en-
courage divergent thinking, learning from fail-
ure, explore reiterative processes, gain finan-
cial literacy, and learn to communicate new
ideas. Entrepreneurial thinkers can turn prob-
lems into business opportunities and stay in or
return to their communities, generating em-
ployment and enlarging the local tax base.
The development of an entrepreneurial
mindset in youth will help lead to an empow-
ered society.
Madam Speaker, as I urge my colleagues in
the House of Representatives to recognize
Global Entrepreneurship, I urge support of the
21st Century Youth Entrepreneurship Act. Ulti-
mately, entrepreneurs are the backbone of
American society; they drive innovation, job
creation, and national economic growth. And
entrepreneurship programs in our schools will
empower our youth to strengthen our nation
by cultivating their entrepreneurial spirit.
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF WILLIAM ‘‘BILL’’ ROBERT ROTH
HON. MICHAEL F. Q. SAN NICOLAS
OF GUAM
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 22, 2019
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life and legacy of Mr. Wil-
liam ‘‘Bill’’ Robert Roth who was a longtime
resident of Guam and passed away on Octo-
ber 16, 2019, at the age of 68.
Mr. Roth was a son, a husband, a father,
and a devoted administrator to Guam’s edu-
cation.
He was the son of Philip and Joan M. Roth.
Born and raised in Chicago, Illinois along with
his four sisters and two brothers. He then
moved to Memphis, Tennessee and is where
he met his beloved wife Ann Marie O’Mallan.
Married for 45 years, together they raised four
children and were blessed with four grand-
children.
In 1979, Mr. Roth started his educational
career at Notre Dame High school where he
served for 12 years as a teacher, business
manager; and subsequently, an Assistant Prin-
cipal.
In 1991 through 2009, Mr. Roth became the
principal of Father Duenas Memorial School.
As an active supporter of the institution’s aca-
demic and athletic programs, he was instru-
mental in reshaping the campus by reinforcing
financial stability and investing as much as
possible when the opportunity arose.
Mr. Roth was recognized as a humble man
who emanated solidarity and was influential to
the island’s educational community. He was
also known by many as one who was driven
to inspire students in an all-boys school. As a
father of two sons, connecting with his stu-
dents and fostering growth was effortless.
In 2012, Mr. Roth embraced retirement and
spent the rest of his days enjoying time with
his wife and adoring their grandchildren.
I extend my sincerest condolences to his
wife, Ann Marie O’Mallan Roth, his children,
Bill Roth, Christina Roth Mantanona, Mariana
Duenas, Kenny Roth, and their spouses and
his grandchildren.
He will be deeply missed, and his memory
will live on in the hearts of many.
