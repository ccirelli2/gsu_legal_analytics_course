Load the R workspace called 2018_2020_workspace.RData 
(available on Teams in Files >> Data) into your R Studio session.

Using the txt, corpus, and dfm objects, answer the following questions
in a brief report (1-2 pages), one report per group:

1. How many documents are in this corpus?
2. What are the top 10 tokens and their frequency?
3. From your review of the frequency table, what are additional
   stopwords that you would like to drop from the 2018-2020 dfm?
4. Generate a wordcloud and textstat_frequency plot to show the
   top 50 words in the 2018-2020 dfm and include them in your report.
