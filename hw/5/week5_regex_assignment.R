# PROBLEM 3
################################################################################

# Use the kwic command to extract a 100-token window around the regex you wrote 
# for Problem 2. Save this kwic object as "lw_window" and convert it into a data
# frame named "df_lw_window". 



# What are the dimensions of this data frame? 


################################################################################
# PROBLEM 4  
################################################################################

# As you may have noticed, many words are split in half by a hyphenation followed 
# by at least one space ("- "). This is a function of how the PDF documents were 
# originally formatted and the difficulty of converting these documents to plain 
# text. 

# Write a regex to replace all occurrences of this break in the first 10 documents
# in the cr_txt object and create a new data frame named "cr_txt_cleaned."

# Then check the text to make sure that you have performed this replacement 
# properly. 

#### PROBLEM 5 ####

# Next week, we will move on to segmenting (i.e., splitting up) the text by 
# speaker. We will be leveraging the Congressional Record's relatively uniform 
# structure to split the text at the beginning of a speaker's statement. These 
# transitions (1) start with a new line, (2) include the word "Mr." or "Ms.", and
# list the name of the speaker in ALL CAPS. 

# Write a regex to match and extract all instances of a new speaker in the first 
# 10 documents. Save these matches in an object named "speakers" and convert
# this list object into a data frame.
