HONORING THE SERVICE OF LORIE
GRINNAN
HON. JOHN RATCLIFFE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 3, 2018
Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to both express my deep appreciation and to
say thank you, on behalf of the constituents I
am privileged to represent in the 4th Congres-
sional District of Texas, to Lorie Grinnan, a
member of my staff who has completed 20
years of dedicated service to communities in
our district. Notably, my comments today build
upon those offered into the CONGRESSIONAL
RECORD about Mrs. Grinnan by my prede-
cessor, Ralph Hall, on October 16, 2013.
Lorie Grinnan served as a Regional Rep-
resentative in my Rockwall office during the
first three years of my time in Congress. Prior
to that, Lorie served for eight years as a
Rockwall County Commissioner and, going
further back, served Rockwall area commu-
nities for nine years on the Rockwall ISD
Board of Trustees (including two terms as
board president).
As Lorie neared the end of her second term
as County Commissioner, she announced that
she was not going to seek re-election and
planned to conclude her public service when
her term expired at the end of 2014. However,
as I was preparing to begin my first term in
Congress, I asked Lorie to consider foregoing
her plans and instead continue serving the
public by becoming part of my original district
office staff in January 2015. Lorie graciously
agreed to set aside her own plans, and to the
greater benefit of the three quarters of a mil-
lion Texans in this district, has selflessly
served these past three years as an invalu-
able member of my congressional staff.
Now, after a full 20 years of service to the
public in Rockwall and surrounding commu-
nities, Lorie is ready to enjoy the next chapter
in her life. Together, we have accomplished
much these past three years for our commu-
nities and constituents. I will be forever grate-
ful for her service in my office and to our con-
stituents and communities, and for the lives
we have been able to touch and change along
the way. I am particularly grateful for her help
in building and leading our process for identi-
fying and selecting deserving students to re-
ceive nominations to our nation’s service
academies. During the three years under her
leadership, I am proud to say that we have
been able to offer more than 75 nominations
to incredible young women and men across
the 4th District of Texas. As a result of Lorie’s
dedication to this mission, I know that our
country will be better served by the many out-
standing future leaders who have accepted
appointments to our nation’s service acad-
emies.
Again, I express my sincere gratitude to
Lorie Grinnan and to her family for the sac-
rifices they have made over these past two
decades to support her dedicated career of
public service. Godspeed to Lorie Grinnan and
her family as they look forward to the next
chapter of God’s plan for her blessed life.

IN CELEBRATION OF THE LIFE OF
DOROTHY MAY WILSON
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 3, 2018
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in
celebration of the life of Dorothy May Wilson.
Throughout her 106 years of life, she im-
pacted countless lives and leaves behind a
community of loving family and friends.
Mrs. Dorothy May Wilson was born in Mount
Vernon, New York in 1911, where she lived
through the Great Depression and met her
husband. True to her unrelenting spirit, Mrs.
Wilson did not let hard economic conditions
deter her and operated a catering business
with her husband throughout the Depression
and later worked as a nurse. She then moved
to Michigan in the 1970s to live closer to fam-
ily and settled in Ypsilanti, Michigan where
she would live for the rest of her life.
After moving to Michigan, Mrs. Wilson be-
came involved with her local ministry, Brown
Chapel AME Church. Church members re-
member her as an active volunteer with a
heart for giving and a permanent smile on her
face. This past November, those close to Mrs.
Wilson hosted a surprise 106th birthday for
her at the senior living community where she
had been a resident since 1989. Friends and
family shared stories of the kindness, leader-
ship, and positivity that Dorothy will be re-
membered for. On her 106th birthday, Dorothy
told her guests that kindness and giving back
to others are the two keys to a fulfilled life.
She lived her life following these two principles
and leaves behind a bright legacy and loving
family and friends.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me
in honoring the life of a cherished member of
our Michigan community, Mrs. Dorothy May
Wilson. She impacted countless lives through-
out her 106 years and she will be greatly
missed.
