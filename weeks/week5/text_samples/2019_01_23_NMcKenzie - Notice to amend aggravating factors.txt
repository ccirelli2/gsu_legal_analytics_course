STATE’S MOTION TO AMEND NOTICE OF AGGRAVATING FACTORS

COMES NOW, the State of Florida, by and through the undersigned Assistant
State Attorney and, pursuant to Section 782.04(1)(b), Florida Statutes, and Rule 3.181,
Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure, moves this Honorable Court to allow the State to
amend its notice of aggravating factors. As good cause, the State sets forth the following:

I, On June 19, 2017, this Court entered an order vacating the defendant’s
previously imposed death sentences in light of the Florida Supreme Court’s ruling in
Hurst v. State, 202 So.3d 40 (2016).

2. On August 28, 2017, the State filed a Renewed Notice of Intent to Seek
the Death Penalty and List of Aggravating Factors. Prior to the original trial, the State
had filed a notice to seek the death penalty and at trial asserted the following aggravating
circumstances:

a. The defendant was previously convicted on another capital felony
or of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person.

b. The capital felony was committed while the defendant was
engaged in the commission of, or attempted commission of, a robbery.

c, The capital felony was committed for pecuniary gain.d. The capital felony was a homicide and was committed in a cold,
calculated, and premeditated manner without any pretense of moral or legal
justification.

3, In its Renewed Notice, the State listed the same aggravating factors that
were relied on during the previously-conducted penalty phase.

4. Since that time, the State has discovered that statements made by the
defendant following his arrest gives it reason to believe that it can also prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that the capital felony was heinous, atrocious, or cruel. Specifically, the
defendant described attacking each victim in separate locations with a hatchet, returning
to find each of them still alive and moving, and them attacking them a second time and
completing the murders.

WHEREFORE, the State, for the grounds stated above, moves this Honorable
Court to permit it to amend its notice of aggravating factors to include the HAC
aggravating factor.

I HEREBY CERTIFY that a true and correct copy of the foregoing has been
furnished by delivery to JUNIOR BARRETT, 101 SUNNYTOWN ROAD, SUITE 310,

CASSELBERRY, FL 32707, on January 23, 2019.

Respectfully submitted:
