STATE'S NOTICE OF INTENT TO SEEK DEATH PENALTYSEP 2 SHO

COMES NOW the State of Florida, by and through Assistant State Attorney, and
files its Notice of Intent to Seek Death Penalty in this capital case pursuant to Rule 3.181
and Rule 3.202, Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure, §782.04(1)(b) and §921.141(6),
Florida Statutes, and Dillbeck v. State, 643 So.2d 1027 (Fla. 1994), stating as follows:

 

1. The State intends to seek the death penalty against defendant, Jason Roseman,
and hereby gives written notice of same in compliance with Florida Statute 782.04(1)(b)
and Rule 3.202(a), F.R.Cr.P

2. If it shall be the intention of defendant to present, during the penalty phase of
the trial, expert testimony of a mental health professional, who has tested, evaluated, or
examined the defendant, in order to establish statutory or non-statutory mental mitigating
circumstances, the defendant must give written notice of intent to present such testimony.
See Rule 3.202(b), F.R.Cr.P.

3. Defendant must give notice of intent to present expert testimony of mental
mitigation not less than 20 days before trial. The notice shall contain a statement of
particulars listing the statutory and nonstatutory mental mitigating circumstances the
defendant expects to establish through expert testimony and the names and addresses of
the mental health experts by whom the defendant expects to establish mental mitigation,
insofar as is possible. See Rule 3.202(c), F.R.Cr.P.*# FILED: BROWARD COUNTY, FL Brenda D. Forman, CLERK 9/23/2019 3:42:30 PM.****

4. If the defendant is going to introduce at the penalty phase such mental health
professional testimony, the State hereby requests this Court to order that the defendant
be examined by a mental health expert chosen by the State, within 48 hours after the
defendant shall have been convicted of capital murder. Attorneys for the State and
defendant may be present at the examination. The examination shall be limited to those
mitigating circumstances the defendant expects to establish through expert testimony. See
Rule 3.202(d), F.R.Cr.P.

5. If the defendant refuses to be examined by or fully cooperate with the State's
mental health experts, the State would request that the Court, in its discretion:

(1) order the defense to allow the state's experts to review all mental health
reports, tests, and evaluations by the defendant’s mental health experts; or

(2) prohibit defense mental health experts from testifying concerning mental
health tests, evaluations, or examinations of the Defendant. See Rule 3.202(3),
F.R.Cr.P.

6. The State, hereby gives notice of the following aggravating factors the State

intends to prove and has reason to believe it can prove beyond a reasonable doubt:

921.141(6)(a) The capital felonies were committed by a person previously
convicted of a felony and under a sentence of imprisonment or placed on
community control or on felony probation;

921.141(6)(b) The defendant was previously convicted of another capital

felony or of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person;

921.141(6)(c) The defendant knowingly created a great risk of death to many
persons;

921.141(6)(h) That each capital felony was especially heinous, atrocious or
cruel;

921.141(6)(i) That each capital felony was a homicide and was committed
in a cold, calculated, and premeditated manner without any pretense of
moral or legal justification;*# ATLED: BROWARD COUNTY, FL Brenda D. Forman, CLERK 9/23/2019 3:42:30 PM.****

Due to the time constraints under which the State must file this notice, the decision
to seek the death penalty necessarily has been made without the benefit of input by the
defense regarding any factors or evidence that may mitigate against the imposition of
the death penalty. Should any mitigation evidence be received by the State in the future,
it will be reviewed in detail. The determination to seek the death penalty will be subject
to reconsideration, in light of the mitigation provided by defense counsel.

WHEREFORE, the State respectfully submits the foregoing pursuant to Rules of

Criminal Procedure 3.181 and 3.202, Florida Statutes 782.04(1)(b) and 921.141(6) and the
appertaining case law.

I HEREBY CERTIFY that a true copy hereof has been furnished via e-file this 2 5
day of September A.D. 2019, to:

Respectfully submitted,

MICHAEL J. SATZ
